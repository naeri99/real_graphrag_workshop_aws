  "user_query": "take leisurely strolls through very picturesque environments and they usually give expository dialogue during these scenes it happens a lot in Inception happens quite often in Tenet and often times that score which as I said is wonderful is often blaring during these sequences which makes dialogue a little difficult to hear also characters are speaking very fast and very quick Tenet is technically marvelous and conceptually fascinating but it is however emotionally distant we know so little about each character particularly our lead that Nolan seems to be deliberately keeping them at arm's length so while I was always amazed by what he was accomplishing within a frame I didn't really care that much about the people that were filling that frame Elizabeth Debicki's character is easily the most emotionally resonant of the entire film there's a subplot that I won't spoil for you but basically she's the heart and soul of the movie and she's really all that John David Washington's character which is just called the Protagonist he doesn't even have a name she's really all that that he's feeling for in the movie and and his real motivation for being in the movie seems wrapped up into helping her and so as a lead the Protagonist isn't a particularly interesting character he feels like an object that's used to communicate Nolan's story to us and less like a person this is something that happens a lot in his films in a movie like Inception a lot of those characters are intriguing but",
