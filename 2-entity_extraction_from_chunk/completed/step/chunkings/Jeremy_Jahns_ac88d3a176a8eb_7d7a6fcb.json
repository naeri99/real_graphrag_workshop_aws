  "user_query": "TENET so TENET's a new film starring Christopher Nolan well it's written and directed by Christopher Nolan I just feel like Christopher Nolan the movies are really Christopher Nolan's a star so anyhow it stars John David Washington Robert Pattinson and we saw the trailer right the trailer shows you that they're looking for bad guy Kenneth Branagh there's this ability to reverse time is called inversion in which things go backwards through what we perceive as time but it's in there the trailer lied to us it did which trailers their mouthpieces for movies they're propaganda it's kind of like Fox News for the right CNN for the left movie trailers for movies they're there to convince you that this thing is going to be the greatest thing ever so sometimes in movie trailers they showcase something that really isn't front and center for a large section of the movie and such is the case with TENET TENET's essentially a spy movie like consciously I'm watching the movie I'm like okay so this is like Christopher Nolan does James Bond or any other spy movie new guy gets recruited there's a bad guy and he has a super bad thing that can do a lot of damage to the world so they got to stop bad guys this movie's two and a half hours long it's not like for two and a half hours you're dealing with good guys and bad guys doing inversion going backwards and forwards and it's not for the bulk of the movie that's not the case for the bulk of this movie you gotta go into this movie being like okay",
