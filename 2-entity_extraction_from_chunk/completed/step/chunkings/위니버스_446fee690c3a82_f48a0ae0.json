Our starting point for understanding is gravitational anomaly and distortion of time and space. Due to the gravitational anomaly, Cooper arrived at NASA and heard an amazing story. Cooper's crash and all kinds of anomalies were caused by strong gravity, and the source of that gravity was the distortion of spacetime near Saturn. At the heart of the interstellar story is this distortion of time and space. But what is the distortion of time and space and what does gravity have to do with it? We simply learn that gravity is the power to attract each other at school. Thanks to gravity, the Earth is caught by the sun and is still working hard on the circular motion at this moment. But how does the sun attract the Earth? It's not like the sun is twirling around the Earth with a string. The question of how gravity is transmitted has been solved to some extent thanks to Einstein's general theory of relativity. First, Einstein imagined a two-dimensional, flat universe with no mass and no energy. And then came up with the idea that when a heavy object is placed here, time and space are distorted, and that this distortion carries gravity. This allows the Earth to travel around the shortest distance in curved spacetime, even if it is not connected to the sun. The congestion of gravity was a distortion of time. The movie constantly refers to the theory of",
