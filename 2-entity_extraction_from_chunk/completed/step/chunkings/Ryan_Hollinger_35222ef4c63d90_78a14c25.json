  "user_query": "[Music] there are many films that leave you feeling empty inside a sense of uncertainty that lingers long after the credits in the opening moment of the gift the film reinforces this point with its desolate atmosphere i don't feel trapped watching it i feel much like the characters settled into a wide open neighborhood peaceful and undisturbed but somehow with a sense of absence joel edgerton made a supremely subversive directorial debut that manages to make the most calm and friendly environments seem like a nightmare the visuals initially convey the loving relationship between simon and robin but the way the mise en scene and cinematography work together to imply a sense of emotional distance between the couple gradually establishes the conflict driving them apart the composition maintains the desolation surrounding simon and robin as they are continuously framed within wide spaces that make them seem distant from their unfamiliar environment this shot for example begins with deep focus and switches to shallow depth of field to frame gordo watching from a distance to establish the film's very hitchcockian sense of tension in fact the camera is always free and predominantly distant from its characters in a very voyeuristic way as if we're stalking on their lives this couple are always exposed they look like outsiders whether it be the minimalist decoration that accentuates them are the large windows that surround their house the couple are largely oblivious to how vulnerable",
