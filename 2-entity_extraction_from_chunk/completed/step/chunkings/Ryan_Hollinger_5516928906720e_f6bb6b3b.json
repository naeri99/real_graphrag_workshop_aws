  "user_query": "are the large windows that surround their house the couple are largely oblivious to how vulnerable they are in this seemingly innocuous time inhabited by friendly people including gordo hey thank you for the lovely gift that was very sweet but i'm sure that you spoke to simon about that i know it's only when simon's conflict with gordo intensifies does the film take a tonal shift towards darkness and isolation suddenly the couple's lives aren't fueled by mild discontent but rather paranoia and this unnerving sense of danger but we experience this transition through the perspective of robin who has become trapped and even alienated from those around her especially simon who seems to be unconsciously controlling her his dominance within the household is recognized but isn't forced it's organically developed as her emotions and insecurities come second place to his i'll take an apology for that oh this is not about an apology simon this is about you and me you have to do this for us because if you don't at least try to fix this if you don't shh their love still exists but her freedom feels restricted especially with simon's insistence to start a family which robin is accepting of but never seems satisfied with the idea in fact when the tension in their relationship is addressed simon places the blame on gordo which is relatively true but for very distinct reasons it's made apparent that gordo is seeking retribution for simon's bullying and the distressing lies that led gordo to",
