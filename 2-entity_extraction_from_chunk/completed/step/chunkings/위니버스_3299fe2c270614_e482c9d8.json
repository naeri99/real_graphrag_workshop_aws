So, if you know the mass and spin of the black hole, you can derive all the properties with the theory of relativity. Scholars describe the simplicity of these black holes as \"A black hole has no hair.\" But the massive gravity of the black hole creates two concepts that deviate significantly from our general understanding. It is an event horizon and a singularity that is constantly mentioned in movies. Because the spacetime around the black hole is extremely distorted, nothing can escape from the black hole at the boundary of a particular site. It just gets sucked inside. This is the event horizon. This attracting force is also due to the curvature of the spacetime of the black hole. The inside of the event horizon is only one point aligned from the curve of time, so even light cannot escape. If an outside observer sees a person's clock approaching the event horizon of a black hole, the clock is going slower and slower, and when it reaches the event horizon, the person's clock stops. That's why Romilly, who says he could be safe if he passes the event horizon quickly, is asking Cooper very unreasonably. Romilly's suggestion is to get information about the singularity of a black hole. He thinks the singularity is very important, citing the analogy that if a black hole is a shell, the singularity is a pearl. The singularity in physics is a very small area where the",
