  "user_query": "know about this. But like I said guys I honestly really enjoyed watching this movie and I can't wait to see it again. I am going to give Interstellar a B+. I think it's a very good movie. I think it has a lot of great ambition, great performances, directed pristinely. It was cool to see it in a nostalgic way in the 35mm film despite being in a really crappy theater but the story does have some issues. Some of the narrative structure feels a little broken and there isn't that emotional punch I was looking for in the way the film concluded. Guys if you have seen Interstellar what are your thoughts on it and stay tuned this weekend probably on Sunday I will release a spoiler filled discussion of Interstellar with my good buddy who I saw the movie with Craig Candico, founder of fatmovieguy.com. So look forward to that guys 'cause I'm going to go in depth about everything in that video. Guys thank you so much as always for watching and if you did like this you can click right here and get stuck minimized. Woo! [Music]",
