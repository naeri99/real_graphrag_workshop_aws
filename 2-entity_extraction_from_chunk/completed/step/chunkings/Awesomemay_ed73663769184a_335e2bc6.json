  "user_query": "I think will gain more Niche appreciation over the next few years as there's still so much more to go back and notice and praise in it like all the George and Harold cameos that I did not see first viewing I'm going to give Dog Man an 8 out of 10 it perfectly joins a fantastic slate of visually pleasing films paying homage to the world and style of what it takes from I do think this artsy what people like to call Spider-Verse inspired style does have the potential of getting old in the same way Pixar's recent cartoonish style is getting but it's no problem yet and I will not allow anybody to switch up on it or we're going to go back to the overly realistic animated films Dog Man has successfully landed on the list of cozy films I can turn on on a boring Saturday night and that's all I wanted again I definitely agree with most other reviews that this movie is a lot more aimed for a younger audience but not in terms of a how do you do fellow kids way it doesn't try super hard to get a laugh out of children like so many other family films tend to do specifically the new Smurfs film that's coming out I think I just smurfed my pants there's still quite a bit of nuance to Dog Man's comedy it takes the extra step to be enjoyable Beyond its self-awareness of being for kids and I think most people will have a good time watching it before I go I just want to say a quick shout out to that Bad Guys short before the film it caught me off guard by how much fun it is and I think maybe it",
