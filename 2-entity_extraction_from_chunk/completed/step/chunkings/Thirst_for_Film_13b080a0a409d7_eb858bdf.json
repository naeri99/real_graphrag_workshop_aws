  "user_query": "'Dream' is a sports drama comedy about a professional footballer who gets a bit of bad publicity and following the advice from his agency he decides to coach a team of homeless men and lead them to victory in the Homeless World Cup while a documentary filmmaker comes on board to document the whole thing and spin it into a heartfelt story It recently came to Netflix so I was eager to check it out as I quite like a few of the actors involved and I think Lee Byung-hun is a pretty consistent director when it comes to making entertaining movies however he does something here that makes this movie so... uninteresting to watch because the core idea should sound like a solid foundation for a feel-good movie but it's presented in a way that feels so disingenuous as the footballer is only involved because he wants to clean up his image and the filmmaker is similarly doing this to benefit her career so for the majority of the movie I never really got the feeling like either of them actually cared or wanted to help these people in need unless it could be beneficial in some way and one of the biggest issues that comes from this self-centred characterization essentially boils down to this documentary filmmaker taking advantage of the situation to manufacture a touching story for example, when this footballer is putting together the team the filmmaker is telling him who to pick based on how their struggles will draw sympathy from an audience within the movie rather than director Lee",
