  "user_query": "there's a story based reason for it happening in the movie I'm just saying watching Tony Stark the character that we all loved and connected with in the first one all down in the dumps in the dark part of his life full self-destructive style for an hour and 45 minutes is just kind of a drag and yes I know that in sequels the character needs to be challenged in ways that he wasn't challenged in the first one but you can challenge him without making him kind of douchy that's all his attitude in this movie is that he doesn't give a [__] and because of that you don't either that's all I'm saying and okay now the dialogue there are scenes where the dialogue is well written and well delivered in this movie but then there are other scenes where the dialogue's being delivered at the same time like two people are talking at the exact same time it just feels like this are you listening go to the press conference you know can't the Press conference you have to go to this on man you need to go be hero you can't have yes I'm listening to you all right are you listening to me I swear to God not crazy all right I got you I got you I got you I got you I got you I got you the climax of the movie was cool we all saw it in the trailer where War Machine and Iron Man are just thrown down with a bunch of mechs it was cool fun exciting until it abruptly ended in a 45 sec fight with the main bad guy so I won't tell you not to see this movie that would be impossible everyone's going to see this",
