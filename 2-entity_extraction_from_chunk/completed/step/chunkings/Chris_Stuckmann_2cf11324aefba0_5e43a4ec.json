  "user_query": "sequences in the film now towards the end of the movie a character makes a choice to sort of accept something and it's going to work for some and it's going to not work for some this is the type of decision that a great filmmaker will make great filmmakers like Paul Thomas Anderson they they take risks they have something in the movie that is a gamble where it could go both ways and I'm not entirely sure if it worked for me there are legitimate seeds planted leading up to this choice and in retrospect you look back and you think about his life his past particularly with his mother who he speaks of a lot and you started to think maybe this makes a little bit of sense but it didn't know how to present work for me because I didn't really feel like character wise it was justified it did feel kind of out of left field besides that I was mostly riveted by this movie because of the incredible work from both Daniel Day-Lewis and the actor who portrays Alma who I believe her last name was pronounced Krieps Vicky Krieps Vicky Krieps not entirely sure how to pronounce her her last name but she was marvelous as well and it's just filled with amazing performances and it's a very piercing look at the way an artist with a very straightforward narrow mentality has a difficult time accepting others into his life and the toll that it takes on those around him that do care about him I'm gonna give Phantom Thread a B+ guys thank you so much as always for watching I really appreciate it and",
