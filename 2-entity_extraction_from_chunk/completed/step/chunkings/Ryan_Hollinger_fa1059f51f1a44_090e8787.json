  "user_query": "that gordo is seeking retribution for simon's bullying and the distressing lies that led gordo to nearly being murdered by his own father for allegedly being homosexual resulting in gordo's traumatized childhood and the arrest of his father gordo's intent is to emotionally manipulate the couple against each other he turns robin against simon as she becomes gradually disillusioned by simon's increasingly sinister behavior earlier in the film simon tells robin that while everyone changed gordo stayed to see him yet later while blaming gordo for being stuck in a moment feeling sorry for himself the reality becomes clear that simon hasn't changed either you're a bully you are then and you still are now he's still a bully and this becomes realized in his pressure towards his wife cheating dany out of a job through fabrication and forcing gordo to accept an insincere apology in fact simon's school friend greg summarizes the entire point of the conflict it's amazing how an idea can take a hold really bring a person down that line best encapsulates the thematics of the film there is this emphasis on how looks can be deceiving but fundamentally we have this natural tendency to generalize assumptions without knowing the full picture we see this in both simon and gordo's performances jason bateman does make us sympathetic of simon initially but there is a constant stress that begins to overwhelm his character as the film progresses and simon's attempts to maintain his mature composure",
