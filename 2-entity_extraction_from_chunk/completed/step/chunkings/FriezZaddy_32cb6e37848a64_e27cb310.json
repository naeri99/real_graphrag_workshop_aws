And then he's, no, oh yeah, it's funny because he's, and then after that, Hwang Tae-sul said, he's a singer that he's a student. He just wants to go the university. Psychist, sing in the contest. And then, I, okay, that's here. So he started singing and everyone like, boom, oh really? Oh my god, if the students heard you singing like that, they'll protest you just for you to stop. Oh wow, well you can, stop that good.\n\nSo next, you know, they're sleeping right there and boom, MBC TV station, it's on fire right now. All right, and they see that. But next we also see reporter Jae-sik. He's trying to print everything. He has a bunch of things printed, but guess what? His boss comes in playing, are you trying to shut us down? Everyone could lose their money because the, it is true, if you get it, because they were stopping media outlets. They're censoring, but they also shut down their pressings, everything. So I guess, I don't know if MBC says, I don't know who was burning that building. I don't know if it was the protest or that was actually the government. Most likely the government cuz maybe they said something and one of their newscasts. And then when they caught it, boom.",
