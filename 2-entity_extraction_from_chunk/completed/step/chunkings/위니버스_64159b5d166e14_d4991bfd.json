This happens continuously when a spacecraft orbits the wormhole, and one star appears to be moving in two opposite directions. This boundary is called Einstein Ring. Very complex duplication occurs inside the wormhole. This is because a bundle of light spreading in various directions from one star on the other side enters our eyes several times along the distorted construction of the wormhole. As such, the wormhole of the interstellar was implemented considering the elements of the gravitational lens. Can the wormhole in Interstellar actually exist? The basic principle of wormholes seems very easy when you listen to Romilly's explanation. But it's really hard to bend, tear, and suture the space we exist in. Even if you have dramatically performed a spacetime suture operation, it takes a huge amount of energy to maintain the wormhole's flexion, and there are also exotic problems. If you shoot light at the wormhole, the light should be sucked into the wormhole's interior and released to the other side. This means that gravity should work the other way around. For gravity to work the other way around, it needs something with negative mass and energy. Scientists call this Exotic Matter. The experimental presence of exotic matter has been confirmed, but it is still unknown whether enough exotic matter can exist in the wormhole. In addition,",
