  "user_query": "on the surface level because anything under the surface level clearly isn't gonna work and for my money i think they accomplished that if i did have one problem with the film it would be that the climax is a little dull it kind of reminded me of national treasure how getting to the treasure was the most fun and then when you actually got there it's just in a dark cave and there's not much to see and you were kind of wowed by the stuff earlier that this isn't impressive anymore it's not awful and doesn't ruin anything it's just not that interesting but outside of that i had a real good time the pacing of this film and what it chose to focus on honestly reminded me of a family-friendly edgar wright now that sounds like a huge compliment but i did still say family friendly there's no edge to this there's not much variety in it for example edgar wright would yes cut fast but then have moments where shots would last really really long again to mix it up this just gives you the quick shots and the actors having fun but that's exactly what i was looking for and i think anyone that pays money to see this film are gonna be looking for i can't act like it's for everyone or that it isn't ungodly stupid but it was just right for me and it felt stupid in all the right ways you",
