  "user_query": "choice to have the lead characters be two people who are trying to keep their jobs almost at the expense of a group of homeless men who literally have nothing and because of that disconnect and lack of character development it was hard for me to really get invested or be engaged with the story when the writing and direction makes for such an uninteresting watching experience it isn't until the final half hour of this two hour movie that I'm finally starting to get into it and I think a large part of that is because the footballer and filmmaker finally take a back seat and the heart of the movie can finally become the centre of attention as these homeless men begin to compete in the Homeless World Cup and I could finally start to feel some value to this story that comes from their joint determination as they aim to accomplish something that's meaningful to them on a personal level it's honestly just a shame that it comes so late in the movie because the supporting cast are easily the best and most enjoyable aspect and it's because of them that the movie finds its way to an entertaining and worthwhile finale apart from that, as you can probably tell I didn't really like the movie and I thought the entertainment value was pretty underwhelming in comparison to the director's previous films but it's on Netflix... and I guess if you're coming to this movie solely for Park Seo-joon or IU then you'll probably enjoy watching them, alongside a slice of light entertainment",
