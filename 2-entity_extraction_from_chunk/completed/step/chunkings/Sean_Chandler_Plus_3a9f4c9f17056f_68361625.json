  "user_query": "Kate Beckinsale likewise investing you in caring about this kid that has been kidnapped was quite interesting to me that you said you watched it with your wife and she actually really enjoyed it >> and I think there's something kind of new we did really try with this movie to make it um for lack lack of sounding sexist, like a bit more female friendly and tried to really make it so that the female audience kind of really got more out of it, out of Kate and out of Lewis and out of the brother relationship and the gang and and then like I said, there's just this world building involving the mob wars and stuff that was surprisingly effective. There's kind of a lot of subplots and a lot going on, but it balances it really well where you're able to follow everything that's taking place and everything that's happening. There's even some fairly creative ways that it ex like tackles kind of what's going on. In particular, there's a sequence where someone's recalling a story of how we got here. And it it cuts back and forth between this guy sitting on a couch telling the story and him being present in the moment of past events happening. And it's just done in a real interesting way. It also has like a dark sense of humor to it that has a bit more levity to it than some of these movies tend to have. Um, I was able to interview the director and Lewis and they, you know, referenced like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is kind of a point of reference for some of the humor they tried",
