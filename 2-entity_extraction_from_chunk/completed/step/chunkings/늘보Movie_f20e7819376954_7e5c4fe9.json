You're right now the Hermes is headed towards you starting its monthl deceleration intercept. But instead what I'm proposing is we start accelerating immediately to preserve velocity and gain even more. We don't intercept with Earth at all, but we come close enough to get a gravity assist and adjust course. While we're doing that, we resupply with the probe, pick up whatever provisions we need, and now we're accelerating towards Mars. Now we're going too fast at this point to fall in the orbit, [음악] but we can do a fly by. Or could a fly by if we can't get White off the surface. White would intercept using the MAV. Then we just head home. I done the math. Check out, Rich. 그로부터 7개월 [음악] 그간 지내왔던 쉘터를 떠나 마지막 여정을 시작하는 마크. Everywhere I go, I'm the first. A strange feeling st outside the first guy to be there.
