  "user_query": "Alice in Wonderland springs to mind with the smallest Totoro somewhat resembling the white rabbit at the end of the film we also see the cat bus also shares similarities to the Cheshire cat with his huge smile her father later states that the Totoro spirits of the forest and can only be seen when they want to be seen it could be argued that the woodland spirits wanted to be seen by Mei as she is seeking somebody to play with something the father couldn't fulfill as he is too busy working the two girls and their father later ask the spirits the following which could show that the Totoro purpose is to help the three whilst their mother isn't present as much as Satsuki enjoys playing the role her mother would ordinarily enact this comes with a burden also this is represented humorously when Mei shows up at her school but also when Mei has to be carried by Satsuki in the rain as they wait for the father to come home maybe in the symbolic representation of this burden at this point Satsuki is joined by Totoro if we understand that the Totoro's appearances are deliberate then we can assume that he also came here in her time of need although the moment with Totoro and the umbrella is fairly iconic Miyazaki has said that most people have misconceptions about what exactly Totoro's fascination with the umbrella is perhaps he could be using it as a musical instrument in the rain maybe he thinks the umbrella helps him fly higher or maybe he just wants to be Mary Poppins when a sandal is",
