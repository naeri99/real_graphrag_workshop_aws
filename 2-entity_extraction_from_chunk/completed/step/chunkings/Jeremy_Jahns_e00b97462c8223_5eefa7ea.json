  "user_query": "ever since the first John Wick when we got to the Continental in the first John Wick I was like there is something comic book flavor in here and I love it let me just slip into it like a warm bath and four continues to play with it amazingly also Shamier Anderson's character true wild card also he has the dog he's the dog element he's the one with the attack dog that assists him because it's not a John Wick film without a dog as for the action sequences incredible I think is putting it mildly because at this point you feel like okay it's the fourth John Wick movie I've seen it all before but not like this the John Wick movies do a good job at escalation you know yeah in John Wick movies before you've seen shootouts you've seen hand-to-hand combat you've seen hand weapon combat you've seen human body versus automobile combat but not like you've seen it in John Wick chapter four it just does an incredible job at making you feel like this is the first time you've experienced a John Wick film usually that's something that the first sequel has to deal with like how do we make two not feel like one this is the fourth chapter the fourth installment still feels new there was actually an action sequence in here I was like I said to the dude to the left of me I know him don't worry it wasn't weird not like I was like Hey dude I never met before I went dude this feels like a video game and I meant that in the best way possible and he replied it feels like Hotline Miami my response was",
