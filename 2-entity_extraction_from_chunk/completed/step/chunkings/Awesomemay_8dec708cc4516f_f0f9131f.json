  "user_query": "for a film so directed towards a younger audience but I'm so glad it does this is what we need children's films to be yeah sure we'll throw in a scene of a building bending over and farting but we're also going to have our main characters mourn losses in their lives and learn how to be positive in a world of negativity my only issue with the deeper stuff was that it could have gotten its messages across just a tiny bit better and more realistically if Petey's dad who comes into play was given a tad bit more screen time he comes into the story to really give us a picture of why Petey has become a villain and then doesn't really do anything just a few more scenes building on how much he's a dead beat would have really made the generational trauma plot Point hit better but again they did not have to try that hard at all for a movie that works just fine as a popcorn flick and I'm glad he had a tiny bit of involvement because without Grampa we wouldn't have gotten Lil Petey saying yes after Petey says that guy abandoned me do you have any idea what that feels like what an absolute truth bomb my mouth dropped when Lil Petey said that as the film goes deeper Petey kind of starts slowly dropping the evil side but he's so used to it that he feels the need to keep up the act and I thought that was a clever way of giving him sympathy but still keeping him the same character I'm a sucker for the Trope of main character getting forced to raise and be annoyed by a child who ends up",
