  "user_query": "happens a lot in his films in a movie like Inception a lot of those characters are intriguing but you know you don't really know that much about them the film just works a little bit better though because there is a central reason for Cobb being there and you understand why he's there you understand why everyone is working towards a goal in this movie Nolan deliberately keeps a lot of that from you until the end and even then once you experience a reveal of sorts it absolutely re-contextualizes the rest of the movie it just doesn't really do it in a way that enhances the people it enhances the plot this is a very plot heavy film it's a a plot over a character movie without a doubt and most of Nolan's films are this one though is held up so much by an incredible amount of visual spectacle that is constantly exciting and different and new it's another intriguing and fascinating film from one of our most daring filmmakers working within the mainstream system and it will likely be enhanced by repeat viewings however I'm not going to a theater a second time right now to see a movie I've already seen I'm going to wait to see it again on Blu-ray which I'm looking forward to doing I'm going to give Tenet a B-plus speaking of new movies uh the New Mutants is apparently actually coming out this weekend they finally did it guys they they released that fucking movie so I'll be seeing that hopefully I'm going to like a public oh showing tomorrow I don't know I don't know before before",
