In the movie, there is a scene that kindly explains general relativity. It's the conversation between Cooper and Little Murph. Cooper says if he goes at the speed of light or approaches an object that has enormous gravity like a black hole, time will be slower than Murph. Cooper tells Brand that he didn't teach his daughter the theory of relativity, but in fact, one sentence contains the core of Einstein's theories of special and general relativity. Please check out the two relativity theories in the following video, now just remember that, as Cooper said, the greater the gravity, the more spacetime is distorted, and the slower the time is. Can't you see the extreme distortion of spacetime with your own eyes? I'm sure all of you who watched the movie know the answer. It's a black hole. When a star with a very heavy mass burns up all its fuel, it cannot overcome its own gravity and starts to contract inside. And the final crushing blow is done. Eventually, the enormous remaining mass literally unites into a single point, and the time and space are extremely distorted. After this process, time and space are distorted by the warping energy of the space itself. Because mass is equivalent to energy. This is how a black hole is created. A Black hole made like this leaves only two very simple elements of mass",
