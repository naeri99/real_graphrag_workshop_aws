  "user_query": "moving on from the past to create a new future I like the realization Flippy makes about the only reason he's evil is because he feels like he isn't loved and that was sweet I also just love the environment and the colors in this whole volcano segment all around the film ends with a perfect bow wrapping with them all being the hero in the story I teared up a little bit it teaches kids and everybody about finding hope in the world with human connection Petey and Dog Man share joint custody of Lil Petey and I could not be more happy with that enemies to lovers yeah the end credit song Superfly by Yung Gravy does not come anywhere near the Captain Underpants Weird Al theme song or even a friend like you by Andy Grammer that takes me to the summer of 2017 every time I listen to it but I didn't mind its presence in the actual film it's not used as some easy jammed in throwaway pop song it's just a good little ending tune however I'm going to say it to heck and back I personally think we need to bring back Owl City songs in animated films and he would have been the perfect choice for Dog Man he's literally Dav Pilkey in music form so yeah that concludes my Dog Man opinions this was a shorter kind of random thoughts review rather than a deep dive as I think it is a film that has to really grow on you and I probably will have a lot more appreciation with future rewatches it's a film that I think will gain more Niche appreciation over the next few years as there's still so much more",
