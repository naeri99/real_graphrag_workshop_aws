  "user_query": "is hard to imagine adding the dimension of time. To do this, we first compress the space into two dimensions. We know this kind of work very well. The picture is a transformation of the three-dimensional space into a two-dimensional plane. After taking enough pictures in space and listing pictures by using time as one axis, you can create a model of spacetime that combines two spatial dimensions and one temporal dimension. To understand the time dimension, we give up some space-level explanations. But since you're watching a video playing, I don't think this model has to be stopped. I'll call it a three-dimensional spacetime that plays. And the cube is a higher dimension of spacetime. It seems to be working a little complicated and dizzy. But in fact, creating a high-dimensional mathematical model has only a very simple procedure. Points are called zero dimensions, and moving them creates a line. This is one dimension. One-dimensional line segments have two zero-dimensional points at each end. Moving a one-dimensional line vertically on another axis creates a two-dimensional face. And there are four one-dimensional lines at the two-dimensional boundary. By moving the face vertically on the new axis again, you can create a three-dimensional cube, the hexahedron. There are six faces of two dimensions at the boundary of the cube. So how do we make a four dimensional object? You can move the three-dimensional cube to another axis. It looks like there is a small cube in the cube.",
