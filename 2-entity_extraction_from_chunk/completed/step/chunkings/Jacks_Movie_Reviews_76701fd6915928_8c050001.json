  "user_query": "his most Kubrick-ian film yet. There are some shots that felt like they were taken right out of a Clockwork Orange. I feel like the movie most closely aligns itself with Barry Lyndon. And like Barry Lyndon, it probably won't be the film that draws in many fans, but instead it'll be one that highlights his mastery of the craft and how great he is with character dynamics and so much of what he does right is shown off in this movie. Anyway, if you're new here make sure you hit that subscribe button. I have a new video going up every Saturday. Until then I put a link to my video on PTA and his overarching struggle of his characters, which covers all the films except for this one, so please check that out if you're interested, and I will see you next week. Thanks for watching.",
