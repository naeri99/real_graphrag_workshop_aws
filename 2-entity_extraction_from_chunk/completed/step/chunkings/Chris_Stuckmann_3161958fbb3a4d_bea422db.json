  "user_query": "that also is going to challenge the audience. This movie exists in stark opposition to the Save the Cat book, which was a guide written for screenwriters by a screenwriter Blake Snyder about making your protagonist more likeable and following a certain structure to make your films work and make them sell and generate more box office revenue. I've read that book and while it certainly makes a lot of good points, it never really gelled with me and I felt that it was a way of making scripts feel more rote and familiar, whereas Barbarian is completely different from anything I've seen in a very long time and that's exactly what I liked about it. It withholds information from you for so long and it challenges the audience to be okay with that and if you're a patient viewer I think that's really going to pay off for you. I had a really good time with Barbarian and I would strongly recommend seeing it without knowing anything other than the trailer or a brief synopsis. I think that's really going to heighten the experience for you because that is exactly how I went in. Guys, I hope you check it out this weekend. Look forward to more videos very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized. [Music] You",
