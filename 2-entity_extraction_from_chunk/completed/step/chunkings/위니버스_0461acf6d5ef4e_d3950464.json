The singularity of the point formed early in the black hole is very unstable. Therefore, when something comes inside, it undergoes a huge change. This is the BKL singularity, which exists the deepest inside the black hole. Once getting here, Cooper's definitely not going to survive. Over time, black holes can devour more things, and there can be another singularity. Behind Cooper, numerous particles fall very quickly, which can distort spacetime again. The singularity that forms like this is called infalling singularity. The last singularity is called outflying singularity. Some of the particles that fall into the black hole before Cooper can scatter upward and form thin layers. If it's an old black hole, these two more singularities can be created, and if you meet them, you're likely to survive. Cooper falls faster than infalling singularity as he enters Gargantua, and manages to escape just before meeting outflying singularity. Cooper now enters the cube near outflying singularity. The cube, as TARS says, is a place where time exists in one physical dimension. To understand that, let me first talk about how to express the dimension of time. Scientists use some tricks to visualize spacetime together. Because the space we live in is three dimensions, so it is hard to imagine adding the dimension of time. To do this, we first compress the space into two",
