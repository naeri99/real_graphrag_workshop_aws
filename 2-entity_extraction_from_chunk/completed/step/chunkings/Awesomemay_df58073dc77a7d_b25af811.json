  "user_query": "get into but it's such a good rendition of the books that you cannot go back and read them without hearing the voices from the movie that is the best thing an adaptation can accomplish that goes to show how well DreamWorks treated this they nailed throwing in all the little inflections the silly deliveries and somehow put the grammar mistakes into the dialogue this film is going to alter the way I say seriously from now on seriously I'm so thankful we've come out of the 2000s and 2010s era of every comic adaptation needing to be live-action nightmare fuel DreamWorks has really given other Studios the heads up that hey we can actually make movies based on Comics that actually resemble the style and look visually pleasing and still make money reiterating my thoughts on adaptations a good adaptation to me is a film TV show that cares less about reminding you about the IP they have Acquired and more about giving further value in life to the world it's adapting taking the small character elements and honing in on them to create a story that gives fans what they want in terms of oh my God I remember that from the comic or the novel but also gives them something new to the already established Universe a bad adaptation to me uses too much time to shoehorn in references and fan service instead of actually building it with the story I don't want to feel like I'm watching a movie made by a studio that's just checking off box of what it thinks will please you is today a Monday cuz it",
