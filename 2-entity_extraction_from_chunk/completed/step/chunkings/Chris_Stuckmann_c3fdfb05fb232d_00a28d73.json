  "user_query": "really happens there's very few large sequences where you feel like something huge is happening as usual Daniel Day-Lewis is incredible in this movie saying that he's great in a movie is kind of like saying a Studio Ghibli film has amazing animation no but he really does disappear behind all of his characters you recognize that it's him because he's famous but there is no Daniel Day-Lewis performance where you're like yeah that's that's him because he just disappears you can look at some of even Robert De Niro's performances and be like all right he's he's being De Niro you can't really do that with Daniel Day-Lewis that's why he's so terrific and one of the best actors ever but since the film is slow moving I can understand why anyone would think the film is boring there are some really great sequences one of my favorites when a woman who is very wealthy who has put a lot of money into the house that Day-Lewis lives in she wants a dress made for her she is not the type of woman in his mind that he would prefer to make a dress for she gets drunk a lot she doesn't have a very good reputation the more the best scenes the film is when he has to sit at this party and watch her get drunk and stumble around in his dress and you can just tell that he is seething with anger because this art that he's created for her that she is wearing she's tarnishing it and it's one of the better sequences in the film now towards the end of the movie a character makes a choice to sort of accept",
