  "user_query": "during this analysis I will be attempting to pronounce several Japanese words and names viewer discretion is advised my neighbor totoro is regarded as one of the most iconic pieces of Japanese animated film it is Studio Ghibli's third film and was written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki even if you haven't watched the film you will more than likely be familiar with the gentle giant that is Totoro who has seen incredible success in the realm of merchandising there are cuddly toys stationery phone cases and even furniture all complete with the Totoro motif so ciai merchandise was a huge financial benefit for Studio Ghibli despite Totoro as iconicity however his appearance in the film is fairly minimal he doesn't appear for the first time until the 30 minute mark retaining the mystery surrounding his character in this video I'm going to explain how the film depicts the experience of young children during a tough time in their family life through an exploration of the relationships within the Kusakabe family unit Miyazaki has often claimed that childhood is the happiest time in one's life and this is portrayed through Satsuki and Mays determination to stay happy when things take a turn for the worst the story was heavily based on Miyazaki's own childhood when his mother was stricken by disease this resulted in his family moving closer to a hospital the novelization of my neighbor totoro makes it clear that the mother is suffering from tuberculosis and likewise Miyazaki's mother",
