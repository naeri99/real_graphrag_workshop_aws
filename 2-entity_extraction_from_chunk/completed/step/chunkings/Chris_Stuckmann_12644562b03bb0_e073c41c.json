  "user_query": "a viewer. There were many moments in this movie where in my head I was like good job Joel Edgerton you're giving me the tingles but it's true, he really did a masterful job directing this movie and he wrote the script. This guy's a great talent and he doesn't oversell his acting as well. This is the kind of performance where you could truly fall on your face, you can make yourself look like an idiot, especially since you wrote and directed the thing. It could become one of those performances you're mocked for constantly but gratefully he's so subdued to the point of brilliance in this film where you not only care about him but you are creeped out by him. It's not just that he's this unsettling man, there is a world of pain that you can sense behind his eyes and through the subtleties of his performance and the way he cut this film together you can really feel all of that. Rebecca Hall is also great in this movie, terrific performance, really good work, also a lot of pain behind those eyes. You could really sense that everyone in this movie is damaged in some way, especially Jason Bateman. Got to talk about him because every time I've ever seen Jason Bateman in a movie I've always seen Jason Bateman. I've never seen his character. I think he's a very likable comedic actor but he's never really disappeared into a role for me personally. In this movie this guy vanished. I don't see a shred of Jason Bateman. He gave the best performance of his entire career. He even more so than",
