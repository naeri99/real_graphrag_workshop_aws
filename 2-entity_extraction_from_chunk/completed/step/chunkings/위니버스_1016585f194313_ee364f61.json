  "user_query": "gravity exist in very narrow areas. So it's the best place to figure out the quantum gravity that's integrated between the two theories. Professor Brand's blackboard was full of equations related to gravity, but eventually he couldn't complete the equation. Because he couldn't get any information about the singularity of a black hole. Dr. Mann says Professor Brand has failed to integrate relativity with quantum mechanics, and we need information on the singularities to solve this. So Romilly wants to see the singularity of Gargantua to figure out the theory of quantum behavior in spacetime, the quantum gravity theory. John Wheeler, a physicist who first used the name Black Hole, said, \"Singularities are a place in which the fiery marriage of Einstein's relativistic laws with the quantum laws is consummated.\" The equation on the blackboard was filled by the physicist Kip Thorne, who worked with Christopher Nolan. After estimating the unknown fields, unknown functions, and unknown constants in Lagrangian functions, this equation shows an integral representation of the quantum effect of the Lagrangian functions Now we have enough knowledge to talk about the giant black hole Gargantua. the director Nolan wanted seven years on Earth to be an hour for Miller. Miller, which is close to the event horizon of the black hole, passes 61320 times slower than the Earth. In other words, when Cooper's clock on the planet Miller passes just one second, the Earth's clock must pass 17 hours",
