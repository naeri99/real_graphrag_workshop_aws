  "user_query": "why he's a prince in this but it doesn't matter because his over-the-top accent is amazing the only accent that might be sillier is paul giamatti's in this he owns the boat of the rock who gives you guessed it jungle cruises and yes just like the ride he makes a lot of terrible puns but by god if there's anyone that can make these terrible puns funny it is the rock i used to work in an orange juice factory but i got canned couldn't concentrate yeah they put the squeeze on me too blunt tells them that they need to find this treasure the rock of course agrees and they come across all sorts of dangers including the original army of aguirre that was looking for the treasure but now got turned into okay yeah hand-me-down pirate characters but they're very well designed hand-me-down pirate characters like the pirate movies there's kind of a theme to what they're transformed into and it leads to different powers and yeah it's clearly a ripoff but it's a creative ripoff with that said these are all the typical jungle action cliche tropes that you would see in a disney movie like this that's ripping off another one that's based on a ride but the editing in this movie is so quick and clearly wants to get you to what you paid money for the jungle the charming actors and the goofy action that it's hard not to be impressed with how much it entertains if you're looking for actual emotional moments or twists in the film that make you go wow or dramatic character moments that really make",
