  "user_query": "like Nolan's doing a James Bondish thing all right let's watch this Nolan thing and then in the movie for the first time you see people starting to go backwards my brain would have melted but as it stands the trailer overcooked it showed too much and just kind of compromised the experience but in the end by the end I enjoyed it it's like the average of this movie comes down to yeah enjoyed it has some problems in the setup not gonna say it doesn't but the second half is worth it it's business but if I bought this movie on Blu-ray I'd probably just watch the second half I'd watch the fuck out of that second half but the second half nonetheless so all in all I felt TENET was a good time no alcohol required I do hope they make a sequel and Nolan's not really known for sequels other than the Batman movies but of the Christopher Nolan intellectual property he doesn't make sequels but I do hope he makes a sequel to TENET all right so TENET have you seen it what did you think about it or what's your favorite Christopher Nolan movie you know what rank have you ranked him before has the ranking has it shuffled around as you've gotten older whatever it is comment below let me know and as always if you like what you've seen here and you want to see more click right here to see more",
