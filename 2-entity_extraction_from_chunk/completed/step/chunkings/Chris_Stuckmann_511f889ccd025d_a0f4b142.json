  "user_query": "[Music] Tenet was written and directed by Christopher Nolan and it's here to hopefully save theaters around the world as they begin to reopen I saw this at a press screening only five people were permitted in the theater the theater was closed at the time everyone wore masks there was hand sanitizer all over the place it was my first time going to a traditional theater since March when I saw Bloodshot I've been to a drive-in this summer but this is the longest span of time that I haven't been in a real theater since I was an infant it was very surreal to go see a movie like this on a big screen armed with only one word Tenet and fighting for the survival of the entire world a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time I just read the official plot synopsis on IMDb because it's the easiest way to summarize the plot of the film without spoilers if I were to actually go into the plot of this movie right now it would take the length of a normal review just to discuss that this is a very complex movie despite its attempts to explain itself to us at multiple times the film is a little inaccessible at first for the first hour or so of the movie you're sort of running to catch up to figure out what this world is who our hero is and what exactly his place in this world is it's about halfway through the movie that things become clearer Nolan's a big fan of mystery he wants to have the audience ask",
