Therefore, Cooper can move diagonally between cubes where different time zones of Murph exist, going back and forth between the past and the future. This is the physical dimension of time that TARS said, and, as Brand mentioned, time is a canyon that can go down or up in five dimensions. The Idea of time travel from Nolan eventually leads to Tenet. Many of the lines in the cube are the world lines of all the particles in the room. You can see the rough information about the world line in my video. Cooper hits a bundle of world lines in books and watches to create gravity, which reaches past Murph. We can talk a lot about black holes, wormholes, and dimensions through interstellar, but the point of the film doesn't seem to be just a beautiful display of the latest science. We have made a big historical leap in the past. Humankind left footprints on the moon, and they explored the nature of existence. And biotechnology has saved the starving human race and freed us from many diseases. Not because they are easy, but because they are hard. Interest and investment in basic science should continue. The crisis ahead of us is too great to take opinions belonging to anti-intellectualism such as lunar conspiracy and anti-vaccination. To overcome the crisis, we need to know ourselves and the world better. This is everyone's goal and Weniverse's goal. Beyond trying to make the present",
