  "user_query": "the movie that things become clearer Nolan's a big fan of mystery he wants to have the audience ask a lot of questions he likes keeping things from you as you watch the movie for a long time and he respects you in that way hoping that you go on that journey with him and he continues that with Tenet Tenet is a film that a lot of people will love but perhaps a similar amount of people will not love it's a very inaccessible movie at times especially compared to Nolan's other films even films like Inception where people came out saying I don't understand that movie I was confused by it I remember being like why it's very simple it's very easy to follow Tenet is considerably more complex than Inception and it really is going to take multiple viewings to truly appreciate the movie because there's so much that's hidden throughout the course of the movie and so much that that flies by very quickly very important insert shots for instance that happened very quickly early on in the scene that later in the movie really mean something for the characters I respect a filmmaker who takes the amount of studio money that he does to make these audacious movies that make people scratch their heads Tenet is not Nolan's best film by a long shot but I really liked it I really enjoyed watching this film the spectacle is awe-inspiring visually it's miraculous the things he's able to accomplish in camera with very little visual effects is really impressive people are moving forwards in a scene while",
