  "user_query": "characters and the stuff we want to see there wasn't any moments where I was like why are we focusing on this like I did multiple times watching the Garfield movie and when we do get slower Parts it's super apparent and more appreciated however however I won't deny that there is an actual writing issue in the fact that it does get sidetracked a few times where it kind of cuts story lines in half to focus on another one not really abandoning them but awkwardly putting them to the side for a little while through the middle act it feels like it juggles trying to focus either on Lil Petey's story or the Flippy the fish story and it doesn't really reach a balance but it was only a small gripe I had and when Lil Petey and Petey's storyline is on screen it was so Perfection that I completely ignored that problem there's a small emotional Essence that gets built up throughout the film as Petey reflects on how he was raised poorly and starts to see himself as his dad in the way he's treating Lil Petey and it gets pretty deep with it and the concept of how someone becomes good or bad it's not wild robot deep but it's an added bonus to an already fun film and then it also perfectly ties into Dog Man's small emotional Arc as he deals with the feeling of loss of an old life I really did not expect the film to hone in on the concept of Abandonment and it really didn't have to do that especially for a film so directed towards a younger audience but I'm so glad it does this is what we need",
