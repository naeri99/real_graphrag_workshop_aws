  "user_query": "by a studio that's just checking off box of what it thinks will please you is today a Monday cuz it feels an awful lot like a Monday but then again sometimes you can get the complete opposite and it Strays too far from its source material in a way that's not even enjoyable so it's all about finding a balance DreamWorks keep showing they know how to take the time to construct adaptations that take life forms of their own and still please fans the wild robot brings you into its World by allowing so many scenes to Just Breathe It Embraces the quiet atmosphere and aesthetic of the books I didn't make a full video on the wild robot as I kind of have the same praise as literally everybody else on it but something that really stuck with me was how well it treats Side characters it gives all the animals not only time to shine but come together to all be conjoined as basically the main character there's not many movies that can accomplish that especially adaptations that have so many characters they're trying to introduce to you all at once I was so impressed with how Fink got slowly morphed into being almost more important to Roz's story than Brightbill as it plays on him trying to find a place in the world longing for friendship and when Brightbill goes off on his own we then get a better focus on their friendship kind of filling that void it's even more impressive considering Fink really isn't that important to the actual books I'm getting sidetracked enough about adaptations",
