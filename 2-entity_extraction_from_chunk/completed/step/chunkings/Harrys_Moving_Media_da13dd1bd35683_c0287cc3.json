  "user_query": "kitsune in Ghibli's 1994 film pom Poko shrines are typically known to be in dark quiet and peaceful areas to create a spiritual omnipresence in the film's case the shrines create a presence of the forest spirits meaning that we can feel totoro's presence without necessarily seeing him when Mei tries to convince her family that she slept on a fat furry bowling ball they aren't disappointed irritated or even unwilling to investigate they're perfectly content and in awe of their surroundings despite Mei being unable to prove her claim the giant Totoro resides in the mystical world amongst the camphor tree where it is quiet and peaceful a place of intense greens flowers plants and butterflies Miyazaki believed that quote gods came from such dark places that they preferred to in peaceful places such as forests so is Totoro a God not exactly a spirit undoubtedly however I would argue that Totoro is more comparable to the Buddha a large cheerful figure known for taking afternoon naps the film is set in an outer region of Tokyo before the massive urban expansion of the 1960s humans were still living harmoniously amongst nature unlike more environmentally-conscious Ghibli films they would later produce such as Princess Mononoke according to Miyazaki Totoro is set in a simpler time before there was television and likewise there is no television set in any of the houses we see Kanta and granny work in a rice field and Satsuki remarks that they had a day off school because it was rice",
