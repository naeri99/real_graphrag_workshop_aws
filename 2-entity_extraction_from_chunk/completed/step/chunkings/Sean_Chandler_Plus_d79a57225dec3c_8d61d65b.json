  "user_query": "shoot that that area cuz we had this really badass warehouse. And uh once we got there, we kind of collaborated on working out, you know, what to do. He's he's being a little bit modest because [laughter] he he does care deeply about the action and he actually flew out the same day as me so that he could have a prep day and Lewis actually came out for those two days which I'm I'm grateful for because Lewis's um you know action um prowess is very knowledgeable >> and so it was able to just merge together quite a few different elements from the action, comedy, world building, character work that in the end I I thought like was worked surprisingly well. It was much better than I was expecting it to be. Another big part of the movie is that Kate Beckinsale's brother just because of things in their past is is a very broken person that leads to a lot of chaos around him. And a lot of the trouble in the film comes from that, his destructive tendencies. And on the one hand, that's kind of one of the emotional anchors of the film that elevates it that it is a little bit more character-driven, but it goes so far with just how broken he is. It makes him a very irritating and frustrating character because in every situation he just makes it so much worse because he's there that it it's just whenever he's on screen you're like what is he going to do this time and that's you're supposed to feel that way but I think it does go so far that it it makes for a like unpleasantness.
