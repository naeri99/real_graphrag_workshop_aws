  "user_query": "my mouth like if you don't take anything out of this film at the end of the day there are just some really funny Standalone moments that I'm pumped to see in clip compilations for years to come 7.5 out of 10 for comedy Dog Man's story is very much an episodic series of events like the books there's not really a set plot other than of course the brutal procedure and the first 20 minutes feels like a sugar rush it's super chaotic and all over the place and as soon as the vacuum going into the ocean segment came on I knew the action scenes were not going to have much of any payoff other than just looking awesome however that being said to defend the movie's pacing it does seem to be self-aware about its quickness as there's multiple montages just giving you a general sense of the feud between Dog Man and Petey these montages make a couple jokes about being so quick it's obvious they were trying to replicate the fast ADHD feel of the comics and Dav Pilkey's writing I mean there's literally a robot named ADHD DreamWorks was making sure the audience knew the caffeine induced speed of events was on purpose and part of the world not just bad writing so yes it's a blink and you miss it kind of film but not in a Despicable Me 3 and four way it doesn't outright erase characters or plot points because it's such a Breakneck film The Fast elements are actually being used to develop the important characters and the stuff we want to see there wasn't any moments where I was like why are we",
