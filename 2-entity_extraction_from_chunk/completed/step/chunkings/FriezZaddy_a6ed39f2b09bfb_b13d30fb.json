And although it was crazy, but the thing was, uh, when he was filming this, you see him just in total disarray, shock, at the hospital. And there was thing, gave him courage like, you have to do this to show the people. And you see him like actually like tearing up while he's filming this. And I'm like, shoot, I went to, come on, he's all that with all the death and tragedy. Knows what happened that day.\n\nBut, uh, it was crazy in them. It fast forwards to 2003. He's getting an award. Well, what happened, it went back a year later and he's trying to find him. And he said it's probably a good thing you don't find them cuz right there you hear people over listening, the artena, from the army. Oh, from the millet, from the government. I wouldn't say the army, but yeah, because, you know, not everyone army was bad. Best we saw that guy that found the plates. It's just from the government, a second.\n\nBut 2003 comes, he gets an award and he's thanking him. And he said he wish he could have saw him again.
