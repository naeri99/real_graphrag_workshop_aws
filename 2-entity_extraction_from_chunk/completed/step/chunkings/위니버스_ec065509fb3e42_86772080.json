  "user_query": "but it is still unknown whether enough exotic matter can exist in the wormhole. In addition, assuming that we have collected enough exotic matter, it is still difficult for us to make a wormhole. It's because we don't have enough knowledge about dimensions. The fact that spacetime is distorted may fundamentally mean that spacetime should lie in some other space. scientists are serious about this concept and call a higher dimension of space a hyperspace. In Interstellar, stories about five-dimensional beings often appear. We can easily understand the dimension of 4 out of 5. Because three dimensions are the dimensions of space that we generally understand, and the fourth dimension is time. And finally, the fifth dimension is the hyperspace where there are three dimensions of space. Hyperspace cannot be observed in our three-dimensional space, and it is somewhat controversial how many dimensions it has. As such, we lack knowledge of whether wormholes can exist or not, so in Interstellar, we used the imagination that the future existence left the wormhole open. And there's something else that future beings have prepared for Cooper. It's a cube. But before we talk about the cube, we need to solve one more problem. How did Cooper survive his fall to a singularity? Wouldn't it be right for the spaceship and the human body to collapse under tremendous gravity? In fact, scientists assume that there can be three different forms of singularity inside a black hole. The first of them is",
