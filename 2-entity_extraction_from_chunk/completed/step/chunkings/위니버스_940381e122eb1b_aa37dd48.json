  "user_query": "move the three-dimensional cube to another axis. It looks like there is a small cube in the cube. But to be clear, it's just an optical illusion, and it's just a hexahedron moving into one axis. Of course, I did find the best angle to look like that. But if you add a little explanation, you can call it a four-dimensional hypercube that has a small cube inside a big cube. This is called Tesseract. I'll leave a detailed story about the four-dimensional hypercube as follows. According to the rules of the dimension we saw earlier, there must be eight hexahedrons at the boundary of the tesseract. It would be fun to stop the video for a while and look for 8 hexahedrons. Did you find all eight hexahedrons? If you break up the Tesseract, you'll see eight hexahedrons. Let's go back to Interstellar's Cube. Cooper is a three-dimensional existence, so if it falls into a four-dimensional tesseract, it must exist only in one of the eight hexahedrons. Cooper can observe the Murph in six different ways, even with a slight turn. Just like this scene right now. This scene shows Cooper turning around and looking at the Murph in the F direction. In the movie, we simply expressed the object by removing the middle cube that we had to pass through. Cooper's three-dimensional space is attached with six spatial orientations with a view of the Murph. Then again, we arrange Murph's room on two time axes. This scene shows only a part of the room, but there are scenes that show a full room in the movie.",
