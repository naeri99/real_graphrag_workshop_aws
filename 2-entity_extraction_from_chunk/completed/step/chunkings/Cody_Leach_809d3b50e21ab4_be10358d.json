  "user_query": "that I do with Rob Zombie even though I despise most of his writing it's the same thing here well not quite as cringeworthy as Rob Zombie his dialogue and his characters are what holds back his movies from to me being the best possible version of those films and with Eli Roth to me it tends to be an issue of feeling very immature feeling very much like frat boy styled with the dialogue and with the characters it was an issue I had pretty strongly with Cabin Fever despite liking a lot of that movie and it's brought over to here where just the first third of the movie is kind of like that fully embodied it's a bunch of American dudes that are backpacking through Europe trying to fuck anything that they possibly can and they're high-fiving and they're trying to scheme ways in a girl's pants and they're fucking Eiffel towering chicks with like a silhouette and going into brothels and having three-ways and orgies and stuff and it's just like Jesus like it's to the point where if you put this movie on for the first 30 minutes or so and somebody walks in they're going to be like dude can you at least go in your fucking room and watch this what the hell she's cute but uh we can't rail a girl who's in a coma I think that's illegal even in Amsterdam and the dialogue between the characters kind of just enforces all of that I mean when they get kicked out of the brothel he's like man this place is just a bunch of a bunch of gay dudes man it's gay as all fuck we got to get out of here",
