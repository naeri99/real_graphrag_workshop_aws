  "user_query": "him while psychologically scarring simon over whose baby it is it's all in the eyes he says but as the film switches to simon's point of view he never attains an answer and is left completely distraught just to reinforce this confusion notice how simon never has an opportunity to handle the baby and when looking for answers his eyes are directed from the baby onto his wife in my eyes gordo didn't rape her it's out of character and he's clearly intelligent enough to cover his tracks let alone and risk embedding his dna onto robin with simon left as a broken man gordo leaves robin with a false sense of assurance that the baby is gordo's to make her feel more content with her child again using simon's constant lies to gordo's benefit the previous verse of psalm 7 states that whoever is pregnant with evil conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment the disillusionment that robin fell towards simon is negated by this uncertainty robin doesn't feel she carries the burden of simon's failures but rather the humility of gordo [Music]",
