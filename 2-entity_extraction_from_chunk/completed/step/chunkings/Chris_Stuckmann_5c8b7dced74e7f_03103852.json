  "user_query": "[Music] Interstellar is directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, someone else not going to say in case you don't know. This movie portrays our planet at some unspecified time in the future in which we are running out of food. The dirt is just not providing food anymore like it used to and people are starving. And when the possibility of an interstellar voyage utilizing a wormhole becomes an opportunity for Matthew McConaughey, he leaves his family behind in search for a possibly inhabitable world. This movie had one press screening in Cleveland and that was on Monday. I did not get into this because I'm not cool enough to join those people. I guess that's fine. I went with a good buddy of mine to the closest theater near me that was showing it tonight and that was Pittsburgh, 100 miles away, in 35mm film. That my friends is what I call dedication. I was also really excited to see the movie. I mean Christopher Nolan in my opinion is one of the best directors working today. His films are imaginative, they're fun, they're exciting, they're big and they're all really good. So I was like okay Interstellar, this is going to be my favorite movie of the year. I can't wait to see this movie. It's going to be flawless. It's going to be perfect. Is it all those things? No. Interstellar is not a perfect movie. There are some flaws involved with it. The script has some issues. There are some narrative",
