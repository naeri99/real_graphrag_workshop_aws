Nolan also hoped that the perimeter of the event horizon would not be too large. No one would want to see the black screen only. Given this, Kip Thorne created Gargantua, which is 100 million times the mass of the Sun and is 1 billion kilometers around the horizon. He also concluded that only when the rotational speed of the Gargantua is close to its maximum value, a time delay occurs that Nolan wants. Why is there a maximum value for the rotation speed of a black hole? If Endurance is stuck at the edge of Gargantua's event horizon, the faster the Gargantua spins, the faster the Endurance will speed up. If the gargantuan spins fast enough, the speed of the Endurance may be faster than light. But this can't happen. This is because, said before, the laws of physics prohibit moving faster than light. So, if you divide the 1 billion kilometers at the speed of light, you conclude that Gargantua's orbital period is one hour. Gargantua also has a brightly shining ring. The ring was created by Gargantua pulling stars to pieces with powerful gravity and then incorporating it into his orbit. This is called accretion disk. But the disk looks very different from the disk of Gargantua. The images of black holes that we often see have one disk, and Gargantua appears to have two disks, up and down and back and forth. First of all, to tell you a little bit of a puzzle,",
