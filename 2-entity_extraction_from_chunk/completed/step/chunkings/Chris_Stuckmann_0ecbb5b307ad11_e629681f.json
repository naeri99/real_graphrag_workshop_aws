He even more so than Joel Edgerton's character is hiding this incredible secret that I will not spoil and a lot of this movie really is hidden. This film is expertly built to sneak up on you. It's the kind of movie where as you watch it you think you know the type of film you're watching, you think you're watching a semi-conventional scary horror film but as the film slowly builds to an incredible finale it had me hooked, hooked. And once it revealed what this film really is about my mouth dropped, I got chills through my entire body. But what's so haunting about this movie for me is that an idea can truly ruin a life, that that little suggestion of maybe something can just have a family crumble, a person's job crumble, all of these things can go to waste simply because one person maybe said the wrong thing at one point in time in their lives. This movie surprised me on so many levels. It is such a good dramatic thriller. It's one of the best thrillers I've seen so far this year, might be the best thriller I've seen in 2015 and it is the most surprising movie so far of the year for me. The Gift is a great movie. I thought it was an extremely well-crafted thriller and I can't wait to see Joel Edgerton do something else. Guys I'm going to give The Gift an A. Do yourself a favor, check out this movie this weekend. Don't allow it to become that underrated thriller that everyone talks about and no one",
