  "user_query": "and advertises an action movie because Interstellar isn't the greatest action movie of all time in reality it's the most powerful love story ever told so is Interstellar the greatest film of all time in my opinion yes while many other films such as Lord of the Rings or Avengers Endgame or any Star Wars movie that you could pluck out could be seen as better Interstellar accomplished such a deep and meaningful topic over the course of only one film and accomplished more in two and a half hours than any other film Interstellar is a standalone film and thankfully was never tarnished by a Trilogy of movies because Interstellar doesn't need a sequel the story has already been told the story of a father and his love for his children and this is why I think that Interstellar is the greatest film of all time and nothing will ever come close",
