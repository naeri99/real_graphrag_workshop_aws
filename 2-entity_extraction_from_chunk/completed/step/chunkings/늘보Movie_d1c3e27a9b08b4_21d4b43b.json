Well, it depends how much you want to save for the altitude adjustments for the trip home. How much do you need? [음악] I can get by with about 20% what we have left. If we use 75.5% of remaining altitude adjust fuel, thatl bring the intercept range to zero. Do it. Hang on. It It brings the range to zero, but the intercept velocity will be 42 m per second. [음악] And that's way too fast. 그리고 드디어 정신이 돌아온 마크. [박수] [음악] My chur broke my how are you get you there wasing launch that how bad is corrected the intercept range but got velocity how 42 second well Commander, I have an idea. Go ahead, Mark. Well, I could find something sharp in here and poke a hole in the glove of my EVA suit. I could use the escaping air as a thruster and fly towards you. It would be easy to control be on my arm. I can't see you have any control if you did that. You be eyeballing the intercept using a thrust vector you can barely control. Yes. Yes. Those are all very good points. 그런데 그때 나사와의 통신을 차단하는 Melissa Lewis 대장. Wor it is the worst idea. The worst idea ever not using atmosphere as thrust. What happens if we blow the you want to open the vehicular air? Itl give us a good kick. Yeah, but also the off",
