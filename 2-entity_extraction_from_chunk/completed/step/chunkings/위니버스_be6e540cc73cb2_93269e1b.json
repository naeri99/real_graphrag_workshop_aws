  "user_query": "The congestion of gravity was a distortion of time. The movie constantly refers to the theory of relativity. This is because the core of general relativity is the relationship between gravity and space distortion. But the world around us seems pretty flat. Evidence of distortion is very difficult to find in everyday life. also predicted that spacetime distortions would occur not by observation, but just by thinking in his head. In 1976, An experiment through which we can easily understand general relativity conducted. this time, there was a Viking ship around Mars, and the satellite sent a signal to Earth with the sun between them. Because the speed of the signal is always constant, longer the distance between Earth and the Viking, the longer it takes to receive the signal. Therefore, the closer the Viking is to Earth, the faster the signal arrives, and the farther away it is from Earth, the later the signal arrives. But in fact, we got a little bit of a weird signal. only did the signal arrive later than expected, but the closer the path is to the sun, the more time delay. delay required 50 kilometers longer than expected between Earth and satellite. The team analyzed the signals of radio waves and estimated the shape of the curved space, which exactly matched the prediction of the theory of relativity. Because the sun distorts time and space, it takes longer for the signal to reach Earth. Gravity actually distorts spacetime, and we've done a lot of experiments that support",
