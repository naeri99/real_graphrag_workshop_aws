  "user_query": "totoro makes it clear that the mother is suffering from tuberculosis and likewise Miyazaki's mother was ill with spinal tuberculosis he said it would be too hard hitting if the two protagonists were boys and not girls seeing as the animation process takes a lot of time looking at stills of the characters it's understandable why this change was made another connection worth mentioning is that mr. Kusakabe shares a very similar visual representation to the character Jiro from Miyazaki's 2013 film the wind rises both characters look very similar to Miyazaki's father Kazuki Miyazaki both of whom were aeronautical engineers it is also worth highlighting that all three father figures took care of their partners when they were unwell showing just how much of a role model Miyazaki's father was to him My Neighbor Totoro was rejected by animation company Telecom in the early 1980s however when one considers how much of a difficult film this must have been to pitch it's early rejection is understandable the film lacks complexity there is no villain that needs to be stopped thus creating minimal dramatic peril it obviously was not going to capture the attention of large film production companies who are generally on the lookout for action-packed blockbusters or romantic dramas eventually Japanese production company tokuma shoten agreed to produce it under the condition that the film would be released alongside of the grave of the fireflies one can imagine this must have been a challenge",
