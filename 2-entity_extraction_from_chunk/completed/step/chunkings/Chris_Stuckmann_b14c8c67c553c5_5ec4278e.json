  "user_query": "seen in the trailers and I also really liked that the overly dramatic heightened world of Elly Conway's book started to sort of seep into the real world where people were saying and doing things that felt like they were in a spy novel and you understood why those two worlds were sort of starting to overlap and it's a really unique way of approaching how a person might imagine a world and then being faced with having to deal with that actual world in real life and what elements of both would coalesce and also be sure to stay for the end credits because there's something in there that could make for very interesting developments in the future I'm also very excited to say that I was able to interview Matthew Vaughn on my pre-production podcast and that episode is going to go up on Friday he was a joy and a pleasure to talk to and I can't wait to share that with you guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more videos very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck minized [Music] oh",
