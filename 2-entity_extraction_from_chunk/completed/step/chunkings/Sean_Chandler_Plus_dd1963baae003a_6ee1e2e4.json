  "user_query": "Stock and Two Smoking Barrels is kind of a point of reference for some of the humor they tried to sprinkle into the movie. Just they they just running wild with improv and all the time these, you know, quick snappy quick quick-witted jokes. Um, and I think that that energy together mixed with action is just I personally love that stuff, you know? I mean, I love Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and that sort of thing, but then >> now it's a direct to video action movie, so it has the limitations of budget that come with that. It its basic setup is the sort of movie that you've seen before. So, if you're not someone that's just into like these smaller action movies, it might not have enough to win you over. And I think there are some points where the tone is a little bit uneven because it does tend to can be pretty jokey, fun, and funny. And then it also can get really heavy and like, whoa, it went really far with how dramatic this is getting, how tragic this is getting. And maybe it wasn't 100% calibrated quite right in the way that it tackled those different tones. But as someone that really enjoys smaller direct-to-video action movies, I thought that this was one of the stronger ones of the last couple of years. And in fact, I think this year in general has had quite a few um above average movies of this category. Scott Adkins, Prisoner of War from a couple months back being another solid example. And the director of this movie is the guy that did Scott Adkins uh",
