  "user_query": "as an adult the animation is just so damn good and this movie is going to be timeless seeing it in theaters today and feeling the audience react at all the right moments this movie is going to be around for a really long time and I could not be happier because it deserves to be Hayao Miyazaki is just so freaking brilliant I can't give this guy enough praise and as I review the Studio Ghibli films throughout this year you're going to hear this a lot but I can't escape saying it their animations are just the best there is I think they're the best in the entire industry they've been around for so long and I hope that they continue to make films in the future and they can figure out a way to work out their financial issues because we need films like this that inspire children's imaginations that can make adults think also about the film because you can look at this film and be like hm for the first half of it Totoro seems to appear when one of them is asleep does that mean that he's just in their dreams but then as the film progresses you can see that other things are happening while they're awake so not only is the animation gorgeous and the characters a lot of fun it's a film that actively uses your brain you feel like you're engaged with the way it's cut together with the direction and you feel like you're using your imagination just like these kids are it captures I think perfectly the carefree adventurous feeling that so many kids have the score also by Joe Hisaishi is one",
