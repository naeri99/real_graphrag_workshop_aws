He takes out his sidearm and says you have the count of ten. And he's like, wait, wait, I know English. Once he guessed tonight, he's like, I'll tell him to come down. And then he says it in English, don't worry about me, make sure that film gets shown around the world. I'm like, wow, he is sacrificing himself for this. Oh, a lot of people did sacrifice himself for this footage to be shown, which it did. It's not a really spoiler if you look it up in history. I just have to say that right now.\n\nBut I'm gonna be talking about more, this whole movie. I'm gonna, I mean, watch it. I mean, you can stop pausing right now and watch the whole movie and come back. Very considerate, yeah. Cuz this was a good movie cuz at first I thought cuz from the poster I didn't really get into it from trailers, because I was watching, uh, I wanted to watch different movie at the time because I was actually at in our life to watch, to go to see TV, you know, was right there. And I was like, do I have time? Oh, and then I was like, it's 12 versus, I got, how much it was, I think the prices went up, but it's a good movie.",
