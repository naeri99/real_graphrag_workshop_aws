  "user_query": "Perception is of the utmost importance in Paul Thomas Anderson's Phantom Thread. Our self perception. How others perceive us and, perhaps most importantly, how we think others perceive us. For example the character of Barbara Rose is someone who has no self-confidence and is able to see through the facade that others put up. She is an inherently weak person and allows herself to become the victim. Despite having money and despite trying to make up for her poor self-image through buying one of Reynolds' dresses She is unable to see any good in herself. *thud* Reynolds is also inherently weak. He needs constant supervision and constant care. He is good at one thing, and his entire self image and self perception is wrapped up in how others view his dresses. His sister, Cyril, manages the business, manages his day, and she even manages his personal relationships. What would you want to do about Johanna? I mean she's lovely, but the time has come. All that he needs to worry about is the dress making and this is something that stems from his past trauma. The one thing that he is good at comes at the cost of real emotional pain as he remembers his mother. I have no idea what happened to it. No idea. It most probably turned to ashes by now. He puts on a front, one of confidence and power. He loves how others appreciate his work, but he also knows that the biggest reason why is because of appearances. When he meets Alma she is immediately able to see through this facade. In many ways",
