  "user_query": "I still was so entertained by everything that came before that. The movie's themes of what our place in life is, what our existence is, what our purpose is are all really well realized and Hathaway is very good in the film despite not really caring all that much about her character. Around all these amazing visual treats that your eyes are getting, McConaughey is the anchor that brings this movie back down to earth. He's terrific in the movie. Is he as good of a character as in True Detective? No. But True Detective had eight hours to build a character. You know what I mean? He was just perfect in this movie. He really was. The space sequences were just mind-blowing. Some truly epic stuff going on. Definitely a lot of inspiration from 2001: A Space Odyssey in there and a really funny robot character that I truly did not expect to be as awesome as he was. I felt attached to his daughter when he was still on Earth. The emotional connection between them was so real and raw and powerful and I really felt that. It didn't seem faked. It felt totally real. Like all of the space mission stuff was great. It's just that the way the film wrapped up and like I said no spoilers, there's a moment when you think the film might be ending. At that point I feel if it had ended that it would have been a lot better than it was but it goes on for about another 10 minutes and I was like hmm I don't know about this. But like I said guys I honestly really enjoyed watching this movie and I can't",
