  "user_query": "making meta jokes about the characters on screen everything in this world comes to life and you can feel how much thought was put into it I really love the Little O's floating into the sky when Dog Man would howl and they do this type of thing with text quite a bit and it's super creative no surprise here 10 out of 10 for the animation and visuals this film takes what I love from the Captain Underpants movie's humor and that to me is comedy that builds on itself and gives just a little bit more time to let the joke fully reach its punchline and really play on the bizarreness of the world do I think this film is a comedy Masterpiece or as funny as the Captain Underpants movie absolutely not I don't think Dog Man or Petey can top George and Harold and Captain Underpants as characters just in general but there are just as clever ideas and gags thrown into the ring that makes this movie feel like almost a sequel to it my favorite joke from Dog Man is of course the life is unfair bit I wish that wasn't spoiled in sneak peeks because it really is the magnum opus of the film's comedy and I think I would have loved it even more if it was a surprise scene it's just such a peak example of stretching a joke out perfectly mayor could have just said life is unfair and that be it but no it went that extra mile that's not fair oh that's not fair that's not fair here call this number life's not fair what life's not fair you can actually call that number and hear that voice line and I love",
