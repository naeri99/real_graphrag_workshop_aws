  "user_query": "movie. There are some flaws involved with it. The script has some issues. There are some narrative structure problems. Some aspects of the way the film ended did not have the emotional punch that I felt was needed. But I was riveted for almost the entire runtime of this movie because I genuinely did care about Matthew McConaughey's character, his family life back home. The entire setup of his family was so well done and the launch into space and that entire mission was so incredible and the CGI was seamless. I barely even noticed any CGI. I mean honestly, and when I don't even notice CGI and it just becomes part of the movie, part of the environment, that is praiseworthy. I don't have to tell you that Hans Zimmer's score is fantastic. It is. I don't have to tell you the movie is directed very well. It is. I don't have to tell you the CGI is good like I just did. You guys all knew those things were going to be good. How's the story? Very interesting. And without spoiling anything I did think a lot of the aspects of the way the film concluded were great but the last 10 minutes of the movie I felt were completely unnecessary, too convenient and too much like a perfectly wrapped gift. It just all felt too perfect. Like the way Inception concluded where they were aiming for that catharsis in Cillian Murphy's character and they got it and it just felt like oh yes this is so emotionally powerful. I didn't feel that way in the end of Interstellar. They wanted me to but I just felt",
