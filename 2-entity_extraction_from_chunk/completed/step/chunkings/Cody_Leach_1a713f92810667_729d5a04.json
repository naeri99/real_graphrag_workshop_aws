  "user_query": "CGI in this it really does help with that authenticity it helps make every single injury that you are watching look real it looks like tendons are snapping it looks like eyeballs are actually hanging out and if you're going to go for that reaction of just making somebody feel sick to their stomach as if they're actually watching people get murdered like me and my dad felt like almost 20 years ago when we saw this in the theaters good practical effects are the way to do that so hats off that they went the full mile moving on to the negatives as I said I really like the premise of this movie I think that it's a creepy setup I think the way that they reveal things throughout the movie is paced out well and is done well they do a pretty good job at executing their narrative that they're going for however the side of the writing that I don't think is so strong is the characters and the dialogue and this is something that I probably would have an issue with in pretty much every Eli Roth film that I have seen and he's very similar to Rob Zombie to me it's somebody that likes to have full creative control he wants to be the one that creates the story that creates his characters that fills them with his style of dialogue and then executes the entire thing as a director and I appreciate that I appreciate that need for Creative control to want to have it be fully your vision the same way that I do with Rob Zombie even though I despise most of his writing it's the same thing here well",
