  "user_query": "with very little visual effects is really impressive people are moving forwards in a scene while others in the scene are moving backwards sometimes people who are moving forwards and moving backwards at the same time fight or are engaged in a highway chase with one another to watch that occur on the screen is fabulous it's incredible to see this movie is visually stunning in every way the highlights being that fight scene that I mentioned although it is not as remarkable as the hallway fight scene in Inception as well as a building that seems to reassemble itself while also blowing up as the camera tilts upwards really incredible stuff with Tenet Nolan continues his interest perhaps even obsession with time and the manipulation of it in the past his films have often featured non-linear storylines here he takes this a step further by featuring objects and even people who are all moving in different directions and spaces of time within one frame the film calls it inversion I won't go any further into it than that we'll keep it non-spoiler you guys saw all of these images in the trailers anyway the acting is also strong John David Washington is really good in the film as is Robert Pattinson Elizabeth Debicki is also very good in the film all of the acting all around is very good Kenneth Branagh plays a villainous character and he's really big in the movie like he's really chewing the scenery but he worked for me uh if you want to go there go there and he goes there and I think",
