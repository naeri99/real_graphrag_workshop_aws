  "user_query": "The Gift is written and directed by Joel Edgerton as well as starring Jason Bateman, Rebecca Hall, and Joel Edgerton and this film is about a very creepy guy, a creepy guy who keeps coming by the new house of Jason Bateman and Rebecca Hall who are a happily married couple. He's leaving them presents, he's buying them goldfish, he's writing them personal notes and he's showing up inexplicably all around town wherever they happen to be. But it's not just about a creepy stalker, it's really about how the past can haunt you, how an idea can seep into someone's mind even if it's not true and how all of these things can come to a head in an incredibly surprising dramatic thriller that knocked me flat. When I first saw the trailer for The Gift I was forced to, I was at a movie and they showed it and I don't usually like to see trailers because they can give you false expectations, they can be poorly edited which is exactly what the trailer for The Gift is, a very poorly edited trailer that makes it look very conventional, that makes it look like a stereotypical thriller where there's a creepy guy and oh my gosh there's going to be jump scares. I was so pleased to discover this is actually a very astutely directed movie. When's the last time I ever used that word astute? It is though. The shots are fine-tuned with slow moving camera movements that really build suspense and drew me in as a viewer. There were many moments in this movie where in my head I was like good job Joel Edgerton",
