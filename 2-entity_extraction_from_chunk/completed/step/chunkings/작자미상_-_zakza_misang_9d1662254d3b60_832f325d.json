  "user_query": "in this work Because the intention of the lyrics and title becomes too obvious However, the film's production quality, including its cinematography, editing, and sound, is of course excellent, and above all else, once again, Caleb's performance is outstanding If the second half of the scenario had been a little more novel, this work could have been ranked as a masterpiece The main character's character, which was well-built from the first half to the middle, gradually lost strength in the second half and the development became predictable, so I personally found the second half very disappointing Nonetheless, this is a very watchable piece I highly recommend it The film has an IMDB rating of 6.8, a critics' rating of 59, and an audience rating of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes As of November 2024, it is available on U+ Mobile, Coupang Play, Wave, YouTube, Watcha, Naver Series On, Genie TV, and B TV That was the review of 'DogMan (DogMan.2024)' To all of Zakza Misang's subscribers, I hope that you are healthy in body and mind during these difficult times, and that even your bank account is healthy and prosperous This was Zakza Misang",
