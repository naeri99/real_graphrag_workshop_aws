  "transcript": "Hello Peter Thorn, the director of the movie Elemental, is Emilo, the younger brother of the main character in Ratatouille He's also a voice actor who appeared as a Sachs in Buzz Lightyear Also, asian boy Russell, who appeared in the skish and movie industry, is a character modeled after Peter Thorn He also made his directorial debut in 2015 with Good Dino and became the first Korean director in both Disney and Pixar Director Dan Scanlon, who participated in many successful films such as Carr, Ratatouille, Monster University, and Soul, introduced him as a talented artist Peter Thorn, a recognized talent within Pixar, attends the California Institute of the Arts, a Disney-founded school and animation Harvard He's also got a brilliant career as a story artist in Disney's Search for Nemo after working for Walt Disney and Warner Bros Elemental's story is about immigrants, based on the story of Peter Thorn's parents settling in America in the 1970s Peter Thorn thought about all the sacrifices his mother and father made, and that thought became the heart of the movie He said that the film's theme was the sacrifice of parents, the discrimination and hatred of their parents, which were essential for immigrant families But unfortunately, Peter Thorn's parents died without seeing the film while working on Elemental In an interview, director Peter Thorn said every time, \"I tried to honor my parents and not forget them. thank one's parents. \"I miss you\". I always talk about my parents in every interview Also, since the story of Peter Son is the theme of this movie, the Korean image of eating spicy food is changed into a scene of eating hot food The main character, Amber, calls her father Ashfa, and the name is inspired by her father, a word that calls her father in Korea Not only that, but Amber was born in the United States, so she's familiar with English, but at home, she calls her family by her parents' mother tongue, which shows the second generation of immigrants In addition, the Amber family's shop was purposely designed to look like a Korean cauldron, and this ventilator in the store was modeled after a ventilator that is common in Korean meat restaurants In the Elemental movie, there's a scene where Peter Thorn's father bowed to his family just before he left when he immigrated to the United States Disney's Elemental was chosen as the title using Elemental, an English word meaning element The reason why I named it like this is because the story is based on the original theory that the world is made up of water, fire, earth, and air The reason why I made this movie is because of the periodic table that Peter Thorn saw in high school Peter Thorn looked at the periodic table, and when he was a kid, the apartment looked like people living in boxes I thought it was a good metaphor for a variety of people Also, the reason why it depicts the story of a fire and water meeting among the four elements is that Peter Son married a woman of a different nationality than a Korean Peter Son's grandmother passed away leaving a will to marry a Korean woman, but Peter Son felt burdened when he heard the will I thought that I should melt the pressure I felt then into the opposite elements of fire and water, so I made the story of Elemental into a story of meeting fire and water Also, the reason why we chose fire and water is because we wanted to bring the most common opposite property However, Pixar Studio is a studio that produces cars, toy stories, etc. and has a good ability to express hard textures It was the first time in Pixar's studio to express elements, so Peter Thorn himself He said that the work was so difficult that he said it was too difficult. As it was hard work, he had to put in time and manpower He said it took Peter Thorn seven years since he first started painting, and it was so hard that his budget tripled In Elemental, there's a big city called Elemental City where all four elements of water, fire, soil, and air come together The motif of Elemental City is New York, where director Peter Thorn grew up There's something in common that there's a huge mix of people living together, and that the city has changed with immigrants coming in It was also in New York that Peter Thorne's parents opened their first grocery store after immigration The Buddhist elements usually live in a region called Firetown, and this place seems to have its motif from Koreatown and Chinatown, where immigrant Koreans and Chinese usually live Elemental's primary pioneering element, the water element, is similar to the white American class that migrated from England to the United States Second, air elements that come to Elemental City have a lot in common with black Americans because they say they are athletic and second, they come to the city There are many opinions that the Element City Hall was built on the basis of the elemental village, and the city hall's bureaucracy appeared as the elemental soil, so it is similar to the American Jewish community Finally, the element that came to Element City is similar to the Asian-American and Hispanic immigrants because they originally lived in their hometown of Fireland and they didn't have much amenities Also, even if you say the same thing, being teased for having a slightly different accent because of the language you used or being wary of by many people because you are strangers is the same discrimination that immigrants had to face The protagonists of Elemental are Amber and Wade, and others include Amber's parents, Bernie and Cinder, and neighbor Claude, and Wade's mother, Brooke, and her younger brother, Harold The heroine of Elemental, Amber Lumen, instead of the name AMBER, which is usually attached to a woman's name,\nIt uses the name EMBER, which means fire left by firewood or charcoal, and the surname Lumen uses the Latin word LUMEN, which means light. He's a character who fits exactly what Peter Thorn said, \"I think of courage, I think of courage, I think of courage, I think of courage,\" and he has a fiery tendency to blow away everything when he's angry Amber is also the most productive character in the production, and she's always got to work on the lights, so the production team developed their own options for transparency, size, and brightness Jean-Claude Kalash, director of filming and lighting, tried to express Amber's emotional line as the intensity of the fire, saying, \"The intensity of the fire had to be adjusted so that it wasn't too severe when Amber was angry and lowered the intensity of the fire for details.\" Also, Amber doesn't appear only in red, but also moves as it changes to purple, so she is the most visual character in the production team, and Amber is the most popular character among animators because she shows a variety of emotions Peter Thorn said that the hardest line to write in the film was the xenophobic story of Amber and her father, Bernie, and that he also suffered from it At the beginning of the movie, Amber showed a negative side of the city when Claude asked her to go to the city, saying, \"All I need is in this town, and the city is not made for the fire people.\" At the end of the movie, several people are seen off and their thoughts are developed enough to board a boat heading to another city. Leah Lewis, an actor who plays Amber in Elemental, is not an immigrant actor, but she was adopted from Shanghai, China, and raised in the United States, where she can play Asian characters in American society well. Like Amber in the beginning, there's another character who shows his antipathy to other elements and the city: Bernie Lumen, Amber's father. Bernie Lumen, as a first-generation immigrant, lived in Element City and was very discriminated against and hated mixing with other elements. So he's also a character who played a big role in opening Fireplace, a general store, and creating Fire Town, a village where many elements live in Element City The signature menu of Bunny Lumen is LAVA JAVA,\nThis drink is a parody of a coffee brand called JAVALAVA. Amber's mother, Cinder Lumen, was pregnant when she moved to Element City and gave birth to Amber Inside Bernie's store, Fire Place, he runs a kind of fortune-telling that looks at the couple's compatibility with smells, showing Korean elements The fact that she tells her daughter, Amber, that dating and marriage are only the same elements is similar to Peter Son's grandmother's story, and she appears as a character with various settings As you can see from the story \"Marriage is nothing more than\" Cinder also has a very strong antipathy to other elements, and after Amber finds out that she's close to Wade, she shows a very dislike. However, director Peter Thorn said that when expressing the characters, they did not only express Korean elements, but also refer to all cultures that might feel unfamiliar in the United States Because of his love for firecrackers and redness, fire elements are also characterized by Chinese elements Wade Ripple is the leading male character in Elemental and a young water element character who always shows a lively feeling The name Wade means walking in the water, and the adult Ripple means a wave, and the name means a water element character Wade's character was created using water balloons as a reference, but if you slow down the movement, it looks like the jelly is moving, so it's not produced at a slow pace I'm afraid if I make it fast, it'll look like a rubber ball, so I've done a lot of simulations to find the right speed But the thing that made Wade the most difficult for the crew was that Wade's head was made up of water, and it was shaking around But I couldn't express the water shaking here and there, but I couldn't show too much distraction, so I did a lot of work to give only the right movement when I was working on my hair When we tested Wade's lighting, we made the character look transparent Wade said that the moment Amber burst into anger,\nHe's being sucked in through a pipe and meets Amber for the first time. Wade, who was a City Hall investigator, saw Amber's store\nYou cut off the ticket, ran away to Amber, who was trying to stop you\nSend the store declaration to the person in charge, leaving the worst first impression. But Wade then worked for Amber, experiencing a lot of things with Amber, who was all about Firetown, and becoming a character who expanded Amber's world Many people think of the popular games of the past, Fire Boy & Water Girl, in that these two characters symbolize fire and water and cooperate Peter Thorn says when Wade first appeared, he tried to cover up his name tag as a city hall investigator, but the scene that looked bigger because of the refractive nature of the water was the funniest The director, who was concerned about scientific interaction while representing various elements, wanted to find interesting parts of each element We could often find this in Wade's water properties Wade's in the same class as the white Americans in the water element characters Wade is not an American or British character, but an Italian character who shows a familial and emotional appearance Wade's mother, Brooke, works as an architect and has the artistic ability to recognize Amber's ability to make glass at once It also shows a family side of her uncle, Harold, and her children, Marco and Polo, in the same house Wade often shows his weakness, but he does everything for his loved ones, so he's very much like the Italians and his family The name of Wade's nephew, Marco Ripple, and Polo Ripple, is thought to mean Marco Polo, a merchant and explorer who traveled around many countries to the extent that he wrote the Eastern Review Given that the entire Ripple family, including Wade, is a water element character, it is more likely that it was created for Marco Polo, a water play that children usually play in the West Claude, Amber's neighbor and smart girl, is a soil element character that grows flowers on her body Because it's a clay character, it has a solid-particle appearance, so it has to be different from other materials The soil element characters are not only flowers, but also oak, apple, and coniferous plants that grow according to their individuality Claude takes off the flowers that grow under his armpits and gives them to Amber, but she shows them burning them After the rebuilding of Firetown, Claude became friends with a fire girl of similar age and had a happy ending However, considering that he appears as the main character of Elemental's element poster, he is also the most non-existent poster character because he only shows a scene where he gives flowers to Amber and becomes close to a girl at the end But the reason why Claude was forced to be an Elemental poster character is because he has the largest portion of the other earth elements characters Gail Coomulus is Wade's boss and the main character of the air element The name Gale means gusts, and the surname Coomulus means clouds The production crew who implemented the gale paid a lot of attention to the size of the smoke, saying, \"We worked on it after setting guidelines on how big the cloud smoke should be in the mouth.\" In order to express how it breaks and forms again, it uses several layers to show the density of the Gaelic character. Gail, like Claude, didn't get a lot of water and fire, but fortunately, he's at the beginning of the leak story He appears in a position where he supports Amber and Wade's story, so he has a higher proportion than Claude In Elemental, Wade from Buzz Lightyear\nIt was drawn on a water bottle. The Pixar production right before Elemental came out was Buzz Lightyear\nI think I put it in an Easter egg. If you go to see Elemental, you can see another short film It's Up's spin-off, Doug's daily special, Carl's date. In fact, Carl's date was originally scheduled to be released on Disney Plus in February,\nThe plan was changed, so it was decided to screen the movie theater with Elemental.\nIn addition to Carl's date, Elemental also said, It's not the intro that comes out in Disney movies\nThere's a special intro to celebrate Walt Disney's 100th anniversary\nThere are a lot of things to enjoy before the movie But when it was first unveiled at the Cannes Film Festival, Elemental was so unresponsive that he received rotten tomatoes with a positive rating of less than 60% on Rotten Tomatoes, an American review site In addition, despite spending more than 250 billion won on production, it earned 35 billion won in the three days after its release, making it the \"worst debut movie in Pixar's 28-year history.\" However, many experts predict that the reason for Elemental's box office failure is that \"many people started watching movies at home rather than at the movie theater after COVID-19.\" In Korea, on June 24, 10 days after its release, many people regard it as the success of the Korean Pixar movie, ranking first in the box office and accumulating 1 million viewers. However, the fact that the story is the story of Geumsujeo Namjoo and poor Yeoju, and that the leak problem, which should be the central story, is treated too lightly is considered as a disadvantage There are many critics who regret that the proportion of air and soil elements, not fire and water elements with the main characters, is too small However, Pixar's biggest strengths, CG and visual beauty, as well as its creativity based on elementary theory, are recognized as very good Every time an element steps on a mineral, the color changes, the water boils, etc., and the interaction between the elements is well expressed \"It's not a bad movie that gets a lot of criticism\" Today, I summarized 100 TMIs about Elemental Did you enjoy it? If you know anything wrong in the middle of TMI or something I couldn't find, please leave it in the comments I hope you become a poviana today, too Then everyone, Poba!",
