  "transcript": "[Music] Iron Man okay so it's safe to say that Iron Man 2 has some pretty huge shoes to fill Not only was Iron Man 1 in my opinion one of the coolest movies of o08 but one of the coolest comic book movies ever made so now the expectations for Iron Man 2 are just bigger than just yeah they're enormous and it's safe to say that any movie to meet those expectations would pretty much be impressive if not really freaking difficult now Iron Man 2 it did have its good and bad like I said Robert Downey Jr he's just great they did some stuff with the character of Tony Stark I wasn't really a fan of but I mean the guy delivers what can you say and Sam Rockwell plays an arms dealer who's like the opponent of Tony Stark I thought he was really good in the movie he delivers one of the funniest monologues in the entire movie as he's showing off a bunch of weapons I laughed out loud props to you Sam Rockwell you were also great ninja turtles and Scarlett Johansson she's pretty much the hottest woman on the face of the planet yeah she's going to be on your mind after this movie damn this chick old news let's Scarlet yeah and I don't feel bad about saying that because that's the reason she was thrown in the movie her job in Iron Man 2 is to be hot period and she does her job well and Mickey work was cool and the scene that he did anything in the same goes with Don cheel as roie but Sam Rockwell was like the bad guy in this movie and some of the things I didn't like well the story does seem pretty convoluted and I don't think it's because of all the characters that are in the movie it's all the story arcs that are in the movie I mean if Tony Stark were just battling the bean en counters in Washington DC and trying to keep the Iron Man suit out of the hands of the arms dealers I mean that would have been just fine right there but there about four to five other plot lines that Tony Stark's dealing with in the movie also it just makes it feel all cluttered I mean look at Iron Man 1 Iron Man 1 was the story of one guy with a bit of a narcissistic nature but that's why we love him who finds out the dark side of the business he deals in so he makes a personal change within himself while he's in captivity and makes an oath when he gets out I want to protect the people I put In Harm's Way sounds good but the whole time he doesn't lose that Han Solo ISM that makes him him he like Han Solo if Han Solo was a billionaire weapons expert but in one of the overly abundant story arcs scenario man too he shows Tony Stark being all self-destructive and drunk you know it's kind of pathetic to watch you just watch it and you're like Tony Stark losing respect for Tony Stark it's that Tony Stark it's not Iron Man it's like Iron Man's drunk douchy stepbrother twice removed and I will say this now even though I know I'm going to get comments about it later I know that this is a story arc that's dealt with in the comic books and I know that there's a story based reason for it happening in the movie I'm just saying watching Tony Stark the character that we all loved and connected with in the first one all down in the dumps in the dark part of his liful self-destructive style for an hour and 45 minutes is just kind of a drag and yes I know that in sequels the character needs to be challenged in ways that he wasn't challenged in the first one but you can challenge him without making him kind of douchy that's all his attitude in this movie is that he doesn't give a [ __ ] and because of that you don't either that's all I'm saying and okay now the dialogue there are scenes where the dialogue is well written and well delivered in this movie but then there are other scenes where the dialogue's being delivered at the same time like two people are talking at the exact same time it just feels like this are you listening go to the press conference you know can't the Press confence you have to go to thison man you need to go be hero you can't have yes I'm listening to you all right are you listening to me I swear to God not czy all right I got you I got you I got you I got you I got you I got you the climax of the movie was cool we all saw it in the trailer where War Machine and Iron Man are just thrown down with a bunch of mechs it was cool fun exciting until it abruptly ended in a 45sec fight with the main bad guy so I won't tell you not to see this movie that would be impossible everyone's going to see this movie you you have to after watching Iron Man 1 and it's not horrible it's not like Spider-Man 3 or anything it's just not like Spider-Man one 2 X-Men one 2 Iron Man one either of the Nolan Batman's better than X-Man 3 I think whereas the first one stands out you think cool comic book movie or cool comic book hero you thinkk Iron Man but in a world where sequels are rarely as good as the original this one's just kind of part for the chorus so it's a fun movie that's a bit convoluted and if you're skeptical about the movie because a studio made John favro rush it out in 2 years and instead of three which actually did happen then it might just be what you expect but if you're thinking right now okay but what movies does this Jeremy guy like what movies doesn't he like is he a total douchebag and watch my other videos by clicking [Music] here",
