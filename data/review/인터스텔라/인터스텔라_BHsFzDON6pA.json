  "transcript": "[Music] Interstellar is directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Matthew mccon Anne Hathaway Michael Kane Jessica Chastain Casey Affleck someone else not going to say in case you don't know this movie portrays our planet at some unspecified time in the future in which we are running out of food the dirt is just not providing food anymore like it used to and people are starving and when the possibility of an Interstellar Voyage utilizing a wormhole becomes an opportunity for Matthew mccon he leaves his family behind in search for a possibly inhabitable world this movie had one press screening in Cleveland and that was on Monday I did not get into this because I'm not cool enough to join those people I guess that's fine I went with a good buddy of mine to the closest theater near me that was showing it tonight and that was Pittsburgh 100 Mil away in 35mm film that my friends is what I call dedication I was also really excited to see the movie I mean Christopher Nolan in my opinion is one of the best directors working today his films are imaginative they're fun they're exciting they're big and they're all really good so I was like okay Interstellar this is going to be my favorite movie of the year I can't wait to see this movie it's going to be Flawless it's going to be perfect is it all those things no Interstellar is not a perfect movie there are some flaws involved with it the script has some issues there are some narrative structure problems some aspects of the way the film ended did not have the emotional punch that I felt was needed but I was riveted for almost the entire runtime of this movie because I genuinely did care about Matthew mcc's character his family life back home the entire setup of his family was so well done and the launch into space and that entire mission was so incredible and the CGI was seamless I barely even noticed any CGI I mean honestly and when I don't even notice CGI and it just becomes part of the movie part of the environment that is praiseworthy I don't have to tell you that Han Zimmer's score is fantastic it is I don't have to tell you the movie is directed very well it is I don't have to tell you the CGI is good like I just did you guys all knew those things were going to be good how's the story very interesting and without spoiling anything I did think a lot of the aspects of the way the film concluded were great but the last 10 minutes of the movie I felt were completely unnecessary too convenient and too much like a perfectly wrapped gift it just all felt Too Perfect Like the Way Inception concluded where they were aiming for that catharsis in Killian Murphy's character and they got it and it just felt like oh yes this is so emotionally powerful I didn't feel that way in the end of interstellar they wanted me to but I just felt like wow this is really well directed and I wish that I was feeling like I cared more in this moment no I don't want to come off like I didn't like this movie because for goodness sakes I did this is going to be a day One Blu-Ray purchase for me I'm going to go to Walmart Monday at midnight and have him dig it out of the box I can't wait to see the film in digital Clarity because I just saw it in 35mm film with not the greatest sound but I really did enjoy this movie I have to praise its ambitiousness because it really has a lot of huge ideas and it was kind of like Nolan just threw himself at the mercy of everyone just like look this is what I want to do here's all of it just BL out like a gigantic vomit of ideas and he just put it all out there some of it doesn't work and some of it really does but the stuff that does really does there are moments of Brilliance in this movie there are long stretches where my eyes were lude there were moments when my mouth dropped I got goosebumps at a couple parts I had to pee like the last 90 minutes of this movie and I didn't get up I was so into it that it kind of eclipses my qualms with the way the film concluded and even though I wanted a little more ambiguity from the way the film ended in more of an emotional punch to the film I still was so entertained by everything that came before that the movie's themes of what our place in life is what our existence is what our purpose is are all really well realized and haway is very good in the film despite not really caring all that much about her character around all these amazing visual treats that your eyes are getting m is the anchor that brings this movie back down to earth he's terrific in the movie is he as good of a character as in True Detective no But True Detective had eight hours to build a character you know what I mean he was just perfect in this movie he really was the space sequences were just mind-blowing some truly epic stuff going on definitely a lot of inspiration from 2001 A Space Odyssey in there and a really funny robot character that I truly did not expect to be as awesome as he was I felt attached to his daughter when he was still on Earth the emotional connection between them was so real and raw and powerful and I really felt that it didn't seem faked it felt totally real like all of the space mission stuff was great it's just that the way the film wrapped up and like I said no spoilers there's a moment when you think the film might be ending at that point I feel if it had ended that it would have been a lot better than it was but it goes on for about another 10 minutes and I was like H I don't know about this but like I said guys I honestly really enjoyed watching this movie and I can't wait to see it again I am going to give Interstellar a B+ I think it's a very good movie I think it has a lot of great ambition Great Performances directed pristinely it was cool to see it in a nostalgic way in the 35mm film despite being in a really crappy theater but the story does have some issues some of the narrative structure feels a little broken and there isn't that emotional punch I was looking for in the way the film concluded guys if you have seen Interstellar what are your thoughts on it and stay tuned this weekend probably on Sunday I will release a spoiler fill discussion of interstellar with my good buddy who I saw the movie with Craig candico founder of fatov guy.com so look forward to that guys cuz I'm going to go in depth about everything in that

  "refined_transcript": "[Music] Interstellar is directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Michael Caine, Jessica Chastain, Casey Affleck, someone else not going to say in case you don't know. This movie portrays our planet at some unspecified time in the future in which we are running out of food. The dirt is just not providing food anymore like it used to and people are starving. And when the possibility of an interstellar voyage utilizing a wormhole becomes an opportunity for Matthew McConaughey, he leaves his family behind in search for a possibly inhabitable world. This movie had one press screening in Cleveland and that was on Monday. I did not get into this because I'm not cool enough to join those people. I guess that's fine. I went with a good buddy of mine to the closest theater near me that was showing it tonight and that was Pittsburgh, 100 miles away, in 35mm film. That my friends is what I call dedication. I was also really excited to see the movie. I mean Christopher Nolan in my opinion is one of the best directors working today. His films are imaginative, they're fun, they're exciting, they're big and they're all really good. So I was like okay Interstellar, this is going to be my favorite movie of the year. I can't wait to see this movie. It's going to be flawless. It's going to be perfect. Is it all those things? No. Interstellar is not a perfect movie. There are some flaws involved with it. The script has some issues. There are some narrative structure problems. Some aspects of the way the film ended did not have the emotional punch that I felt was needed. But I was riveted for almost the entire runtime of this movie because I genuinely did care about Matthew McConaughey's character, his family life back home. The entire setup of his family was so well done and the launch into space and that entire mission was so incredible and the CGI was seamless. I barely even noticed any CGI. I mean honestly, and when I don't even notice CGI and it just becomes part of the movie, part of the environment, that is praiseworthy. I don't have to tell you that Hans Zimmer's score is fantastic. It is. I don't have to tell you the movie is directed very well. It is. I don't have to tell you the CGI is good like I just did. You guys all knew those things were going to be good. How's the story? Very interesting. And without spoiling anything I did think a lot of the aspects of the way the film concluded were great but the last 10 minutes of the movie I felt were completely unnecessary, too convenient and too much like a perfectly wrapped gift. It just all felt too perfect. Like the way Inception concluded where they were aiming for that catharsis in Cillian Murphy's character and they got it and it just felt like oh yes this is so emotionally powerful. I didn't feel that way in the end of Interstellar. They wanted me to but I just felt like wow this is really well directed and I wish that I was feeling like I cared more in this moment. No, I don't want to come off like I didn't like this movie because for goodness sakes I did. This is going to be a day one Blu-ray purchase for me. I'm going to go to Walmart Monday at midnight and have him dig it out of the box. I can't wait to see the film in digital clarity because I just saw it in 35mm film with not the greatest sound but I really did enjoy this movie. I have to praise its ambitiousness because it really has a lot of huge ideas and it was kind of like Nolan just threw himself at the mercy of everyone just like look this is what I want to do, here's all of it, just blow out like a gigantic vomit of ideas and he just put it all out there. Some of it doesn't work and some of it really does but the stuff that does really does. There are moments of brilliance in this movie. There are long stretches where my eyes were glued. There were moments when my mouth dropped. I got goosebumps at a couple parts. I had to pee like the last 90 minutes of this movie and I didn't get up. I was so into it that it kind of eclipses my qualms with the way the film concluded and even though I wanted a little more ambiguity from the way the film ended in more of an emotional punch to the film, I still was so entertained by everything that came before that. The movie's themes of what our place in life is, what our existence is, what our purpose is are all really well realized and Hathaway is very good in the film despite not really caring all that much about her character. Around all these amazing visual treats that your eyes are getting, McConaughey is the anchor that brings this movie back down to earth. He's terrific in the movie. Is he as good of a character as in True Detective? No. But True Detective had eight hours to build a character. You know what I mean? He was just perfect in this movie. He really was. The space sequences were just mind-blowing. Some truly epic stuff going on. Definitely a lot of inspiration from 2001: A Space Odyssey in there and a really funny robot character that I truly did not expect to be as awesome as he was. I felt attached to his daughter when he was still on Earth. The emotional connection between them was so real and raw and powerful and I really felt that. It didn't seem faked. It felt totally real. Like all of the space mission stuff was great. It's just that the way the film wrapped up and like I said no spoilers, there's a moment when you think the film might be ending. At that point I feel if it had ended that it would have been a lot better than it was but it goes on for about another 10 minutes and I was like hmm I don't know about this. But like I said guys I honestly really enjoyed watching this movie and I can't wait to see it again. I am going to give Interstellar a B+. I think it's a very good movie. I think it has a lot of great ambition, great performances, directed pristinely. It was cool to see it in a nostalgic way in the 35mm film despite being in a really crappy theater but the story does have some issues. Some of the narrative structure feels a little broken and there isn't that emotional punch I was looking for in the way the film concluded. Guys if you have seen Interstellar what are your thoughts on it and stay tuned this weekend probably on Sunday I will release a spoiler filled discussion of Interstellar with my good buddy who I saw the movie with Craig Candico, founder of fatmovieguy.com. So look forward to that guys 'cause I'm going to go in depth about everything in that video. Guys thank you so much as always for watching and if you did like this you can click right here and get stuck minimized. Woo! [Music]"
