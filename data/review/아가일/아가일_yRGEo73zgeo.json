  "transcript": "[Music] Argy is a new film from Matthew vaugh The Man Behind layer cak Stardust kickass The Kingsmen movies X-Men first Class so many great films and it's about a reclusive author who writes novels about a secret agent and a global spy Syndicate who realizes the plot of the new book she's writing has started to mirror realworld events in real time Bryce Alis Howard plays this author and one of my favorite things about Argyle immediately is the way it explores how a writer might see their world how they imagine what they're creating on the page but also how they look around in real life and sometimes insert their Creations into real life in this case Matthew vaugh found a really creative way to show how her brain is working while she's writing imagining her character saying certain things and then thinking no that's just not working actually seeing the words on the page fall away and the hero of her story story looking at her in the eye and wondering why she has writer block and what she's going to do about it and any writer who's ever been in that situation can relate her lead character in her spy series Argyle is played by Henry caval who has hair just like John Travolta in Broken Arrow and I can only imagine that putting life into these pages of her book for us to see was very fun for Matthew vau because he gets to be extremely Fantastical and Larger than Life with all of these sequences but the engine of the movie really starts to run when Sam Rockwell character Aiden shows up who's a super spy who's trying to help Bryce Dallas Howard's character figure out why her novels are mirring real life Sam Rockwell is one of the most likable and charismatic actors out there he's so extremely talented and he is by far my favorite part of this movie they go on a journey together to figure out what exactly is going on that can admittedly feel a little bit cluttered sometimes a lot of things are happening all at once and you're sort of thrown into a lot of very heavy expositional scenes quite often which is necessary when you have this much backstory but I'll also say that as the film progresses there were a lot of reveals that I didn't anticipate there were things I was waiting for that didn't quite happen in the ways that I expected them to and other times things happened about the way I expected them to it's a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to surprises there's one fairly big one that worked very well for me but other than that I found that I was able to pretty much see where the rest of it was going besides the excellent casting where the movie really stands out is its action sequences obviously Matthew vaugh has directed some really great action scenes in the past and there's a few very impressive ones here namely one involving skating I don't want to give anything away that's all I'll say it was quite mind-blowing and knowing that it's a combination of actors and doubles and CGI and some truly truly masterful stunt work made it all the more exciting for me to watch although I will say that I do think there's a bit of an overuse of CGI elements I have to give major props to to Matthew Von's stunt team they are terrific they are taking some very nasty looking Falls that look bone breaking really impressive work but I will say that the CGI elements that are sometimes utilized around these stunts do distract from what I think is the beauty of the stunts the visual effects of the movie are mostly very good but there are some action sequences where they stand out as making it look a little more impossible than it would if if you just focused on the stunt team doing what they do best and one thing I do want to point out though is that some characters are given the opportunity to take some people out some people who are giving them a really hard time and they could just end it but they choose to incapacitate the person instead and leave and you know they're coming back and you have to sit back and wonder why aren't they taking that opportunity and it's probably because the story would end and there wouldn't be anywhere else to go but the hyper stylized fights were really fun to watch especially the one on the train that we've seen in the trailers and I also really liked that the overly dramatic heightened world of Ellie Conway's book started to sort of seep into the real world where people were saying and doing things that felt like they were in a spy novel and you understood why those two worlds were sort of starting to overlap and it's a really unique way of approaching how a person might imagine a world and then being faced with having to deal with that actual world in real life and what elements of both would coales and also be sure to stay for the end credits because there's something in there that could make for very interesting developments in the future I'm also very excited to say that I was able to interview Matthew vaugh on my pre-production podcast and that episode is going to go up on Friday he was a joy and a pleasure to talk to and I can't wait to share that with you guys thank you so much as always for watching look forward to more videos very soon and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck minized [Music] oh",
