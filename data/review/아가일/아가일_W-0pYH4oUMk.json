  "transcript": "[Music] we just got back from the movies we saw Argy the the Eraserhead uh Henry caval movie Spy Thriller this is a spy action comedy directed by Matthew vaugh and looks uh crazy it's got uh Bri Dallas Howard Henry caval John Cena uh Sam Rockwell Sam Rockwell how can I not bring up Sam Rockwell who is amazing in this film there's not enough Sam Rockwell after seeing this I need more Sam Ro Seven Psychopaths you should watch seven psych you should and it has Christopher walking you seen I love okay so uh as far as this film goes um oh o yeah ooh I'm over here looking at the uh critics are ripping into this one on Rotten Tomatoes 36% right now I take a picture of that 36 36 there's what there's no audience rating that's kind of weird um there must be a certain amount of votes before they put uh well I guess we saw this we we did see it on Thursday um so okay arill uh should you see this well um the critics are part I'll give you my opinion up front I loved it I loved it I thought it was creative I thought it was engaging it had tons of twists and turns it was overthe toop fantasy story you you this film is going to go one of two ways for you it's just going to be too much too too over the top too silly and and you'll be out of it or you you go in with the mindset that this is going to be C be fun it's you know you've seen the trailers and for me the trailers it basically delivers on the premise of that trailer um and even in ways that I did not expect so um it does read or read it does rather watch like a campy fun spy novel with twists and turns so I thought it was good uh don't go into this thinking this is a Henry caval film cuz this is not this is not a vehicle for him I thought I I mean you think he's going to be in it more I already prepared myself it's like oh he plays a book character and then there's a real life with with Sam Rockwell it's going to be Sam Rockwell is kind of what I was looking at and that's and Bryce Dallas Howard um and uh that's essentially what we got it was he was kind of very limited in that sense but in my opinion everybody does a wonderful job with their characters and I now can confirm I do in fact have a crush on Bryce Dallas Howard this film I I already knew did but this one really really hammered it home from me I'll I'll watch anything with her in it she's a real one and um I do think the film does okay the film goes a little too far it's like running across the finish line and then going like 10 to 15 feet too far you know it it goes just a little bit there's one tacked on kind of thing at the end one final reveal that I didn't think we needed at all and in fact it kind of spoils the achievement and kind of takes away from the characters that we do care about we can talk about in the spoilers this is a film where you don't want to give away any spoilers so I will say the film has energy the action scenes were you know filmed well Sam Rockwell is a great actor he needs to give more roles he's got an Oscar he got an Oscar Rec he's got an Oscar no idea he's an amazing actor well best I I really really like this I have no idea why critics gave this a 30 in the 30s I've seen oh I we know how Rotten Tomatoes works it's an aggregate of people say yeah it's not all that great right and then just many people say that but I'm going to be the one voice that says I had a lot of fun with this one so what did you go now let's see what you I going say a 30 that's [ __ ] night swim right that's [ __ ] night swim that that is nothing yeah it's not getting a 37 out of 100 it's just saying that 30 like but I think even night swim did better than this on Rotten Tomatoes let me look it up if if out of 100 uh 70% of people give it a 5 out of 10 and then 30% of the people give it a 6 out of 10 it's going to get a 30 so basically it's a lot of people thought it was all right yeah a lot of so it doesn't mean that it's terrible it just it means that most people don't think it's certified fresh I disagree I think it is stifi I enjoy this film uh uh Sam was like the highlight of it yeah he made the jokes the chemistry between him and uh Bryce Ellis was amazing oh yeah but um what kind of felt for me kind of Comedy is so good it's like it is so natural he's like an [ __ ] but he's not an [ __ ] it's he come he does that really really well he does just down to earth kind like you were saying as well like the third act for me kind of felt too long and drawn out that's what kind of lost me I was having a great time over the top it was silly whatever go for it but it was just too long it wore out it's welcome I can't I can't see it wearing out it's welcome that's probably what happened for critics I Was Wrong by the way night swim 22% from critics oh okay it's they think it's better I'm curious to see what audience I think I'm going to assume audiences think that was a lot of fun cuz this has a lot of crowd-pleasing moments for me for a lot of the actions that train sequence uh that you see a little bit in the trailer that's almost going worth going to the theater alone I I just love the the the song that comes up for it I don't know what song that is but every time I hear that song I think of trading places where Eddie Murphy is like get out where people are smoking doing drugs and Wrecking his house that he now owns that that scene never left my head [Music] but get out that scene with the song and and they play that song while everybody's beating everybody up is great and then there you know that's not I thought okay we're probably never going to get a another good sequence in that way and we do we get another one and then a third one that is very colorful youve probably seen a little bit of it in the trailers and uh I thought it was interestingly shot so Matthew vaugh you don't know uh he recently does you know the kingsman kind of stuff he has his own visual style I like it here he does a lot of uh point of view shots like and I really mean point of view I I mean like eyes like eyes opening you even see eyelashes a lot in these in these shots and it's really kind of this is definitely in per in at times in the perspective of the author the the girl uh what's her name um Ellie yeah her character name with Bry Bryce Dallas Howard's character in the movie and um you know we really get into her head at times in this and what's going on you know being kind of thrust into this Spy World and more stuff later on it's just I thought it was it was cool and clever use of slow-mo so anytime they do the slow-mo there there is impact there whereas it's planting seeds yeah whereas spelling dirt [ __ ] Zack Snider Zack Snider he used to know how to do slow-mo that 300 shot will never leave my head but recently he's not knowing how to use it the slow-mo here is used well um it's it's I what I can say is it's genuine it's it's funny it's entertaining it's got the energy and surprisingly it's a good date movie I think that a lot of couples it's like a couples type movie in a way that I think the right couples are really going to uh love what what's here it totally works for me now we can't forget about Brian Brian Cranston yeah Brian Cranston is always a great actor uh there so many people in this yeah there's so many good people in this but I will say I as a head of a organization kind of villain thing I don't really buy him he plays he okay we'll have to talk he does a good job but there's some stuff like I see Brian Cranston you know sometimes and then sometimes I he he plays certain roles really well and he does that here we'll talk about it um Alex what' you think uh I thought it was pretty good I like I like his style um this is nowhere near his best work he he's worked on so many and I I understand where the critics are coming from where you know Kingsman is tight Kingsman one is tight it's a great it's like action it's comedy that [ __ ] is serious yeah this is not serious don't go in expecting this was even further than uh Kingsman 2 like he got wacky in Kingsman too and I was still long to ride because I like I I'm to like it's a wave of is that the one with the Russian guy where he's dancing and elen John is in it and like there's all sorts of craziness happening in there and it it like his stuff is like a title wave and as long as you let you go with it and then it's fine but if you try to fight it you just going to drown and it's not going to work out and so like I was along for the ride of stupid and this movie is very stupid you can't think about it at all but that's what like that it like I said this is more think about it in spoilers cuz there are some stupid on it's very that's very dumb but it's a it's a comedy action film it's competently shot it's super well acted I love Sam Rockwell and I do think it's a good time yeah I think the the script the energy the actors who are totally in the role help carry the the film and all the problems that it has here and there like going too far in some places or being o overly stupid or saying wait if you really think about that could that I don't know if you could put do that for that long kind of thing it's like it you know but everybody but it works so well that the suspension of disbelief is there and you don't really care because you're having a good time and you're like it's silly it's supposed to be silly essentially like we're reading a campy book just like the author here where she creates this Henry caval eraser head guy wearing a stupid costume that people cosplay I'm like nobody would nobody would that's gu's worse than you know and I was thinking as I was looking at Henry do his best uh James Bond impression and his Best Buy impression I was like I don't know what who who his agent is if this is doing a disservice to the campaign of Henry Cabell becoming James Bond if now like the the the studio heads are like oh you did Ary no cuz you've done a parody of a James Bond now you don't get to be James Von so I don't think he's going to be in the running anymore because of this film but I don't think he gives a [ __ ] he's like look I look and often when we figure out about stuff and readings and roles it's already long past so he was probably in the running for that never happened or whatever fell apart and we don't have to worry the right now I think he's the right age for Bon now he may be the wrong size for Bond or who knows maybe Hollywood operates differently and they said because you did this now I can see easier as James Bond I think the reverse because it's he's definitely playing the James Bond type character over the top anyways um so uh overall I enjoy let's go with final verdicts and then we can jump into a large spoilers while I don't I don't think that this film is going to do well at the theaters I was already seeing some some articles saying oh what ticket sales are not that great or whatever I was like honestly I didn't really see this marketed in at least in my area very well so I forgot was gonna come out right other than it being Henry cavell's film that comes out after the fact that he lost the Superman job I mean what is it Matthew vaugh does he really have that kind of draw anymore it's not Kingsmen so it's not something that mass audiences are familiar with I don't think it will do as well as Kingsman so I I think it probably won't be a box off as h um but I don't really care I paid for it and it's it's Winn oh that's right it is Apple loses a bunch of money on it great [ __ ] them Fu um or they'll just they'll just put it on their streaming service and'll probably do well I think this is the kind of movie that actually will have decent legs yeah because it you know it is a fun this is the kind of thing that I think streaming thing yeah it's a good streaming thing I think Mass audien I do think you should go to theaters yeah I'm sorry go ahead it's pretty good um so they do have an after credits scene so stupid we're going to have to talk about this Matthew I'll just say right now Matthew vaugh has great ambition okay he's an ambitious guy and it's you you're you precious you're just precious moving on we'll talk about it you talking about yeah we'll talk about it got a lot of money and so Apple's got a lot of money I you know I don't think it's going to do well but take it from me if you go in with the right mindset dumb fun dumb spy fun if you like Sam Rockwell if you like Bryce Dallas Howard as much as I do you're going to really enjoy this film okay uh what do they call it um let's do the worly bird yes I I if if you need to practice that dance anymore just call me up we'll do the word whirly bird uh so and that's an ongoing joke and a good one in the film so we'll go into spoilers now thank you so much for watching uh check out oh finals I didn't even get the final verse let's go um for me I really enjoy this one uh you should check it out um I was going to go to eight but again the the third act kind of fell for me okay yeah so I'm more of at a seven I had a great time it still enjoyable watch I love the chemistry between them Sam nailed it um yeah just like at the end I just like I was kind of getting bored the end last year the end it went went much it's like we've seen this you're doing it again yeah and I'm trying to like without and then you do it and then you do another thing and I'm like that wasn't necessary exactly and even me that was fully invested so I see where a lot of critics jumped off or whatever they probably weren't they probably lost halfway in it and by then they were like oh no [ __ ] you now we're going down to 30 yeah like but for me I was like you know what you press it's all right go just hurry up when I when I rewatch it I'll skip this last part but we're good yeah and without getting spoiler some of it kind of like didn't need to happen but whatever yeah I I agree I think that um I actually the start thought the start first half of this movie was actually really solid and then I was like okay all we have to do is wrap this up and get going okay cool big action set piece wow that was way too long uh oh we're going into another huge jaon set piece wow this one is like four times as long as it needs to be like holy [ __ ] someone needs to just be like Matthew buddy you did it you you have you got a great film Matthew you're indulging what is it called self-indulgent all all he needed was someone to be like hey man we need to cut this down a little bit because our the run time is you make it tighter people want to rewatch yeah and it it does it just drags ass and then even at the very end of the movie the the the thing that they're setting up just drags ass and it's like how do you like you you just [ __ ] it up and like every everything there everything is good it's just they just kind of flubbed the ending a little bit but I do think it's a it's a dumb I mean it's [ __ ] dumb but it's so fun that it doesn't matter so I'm going to give it a seven so perfect yeah even the end like Alex was saying the end credits it's like get to the point I know it's like you're setting no one cares what you're setting up here you are way more excited than what is being shown on screen so okay I am going to go with like I said because like I was excusing it a lot more because I already had so much fun I was already done but it did take a down points as well for me so y'all both going seven I'll go eight eight out of 10 I enjoyed it I would definitely watch it again I think success I'm happy that Henry is like great it's like is this going to be one that's bad for Henry's career it's like Hollywood wants to throw them away they don't care about you know D it's like oh look you're in you're in this that did terrible or it was a shitty film like good though yeah uh what was it called uh we saw a trailer what was it called the war of an ungentlemanly Warfare yeah the club of unen something like that that looks good too so I'm happy and uh whether this one does you know Buu bucks at the box office I don't care because I thought it was fun and you should go out and see it if you like spy Thrillers any of those things that we said and yeah we will see you in the spoiler section thank you for watching and we'll see you on the next Angry Joe show bye guys hey welcome to the spoiler section for arill so uh man there's a lot there's a lot of twist and turns that were uh wonderful but let's go directly to the ends and we talking about it so much you [ __ ] it up at the end you didn't need like we had so many action sequences already um and I think we had a great one at the end oh my God there's just so much to talk about so turn turns out that the author uh you know this Bryce Dallas Howard the character she's playing is deep undercover she has her she has Amnesia and it turns out that she in fact is a spy as well okay and then she starts to regain her spy powers and [ __ ] and and then it's a double cross and then it's a triple cross and then it's turns out she was the bad guy back then but was she really Maybe not maybe she was thinking about getting out and it turn turns out that this agent that shows up to protect her uh turns out Sam Rockwell's character who you know seems to be a funny quirky protector turns out to be a love interest that they had a relationship before before they went in and as the film comes together uh she has to pretend to betray him shoots him in the chest you know when they're all tied up and everything and she's acting evil but she shoots him just right because of the [ __ ] email some fan Center that said you should put the this in your book where there's a little area of the heart that's you could put a bullet through and everything's fine I'm like okay whatever God damn it just fine just make that a one-off joke but what I hated is they didn't make it a one-off joke it was a big thing and a big reveal at the end anyway so you they have them be this couple and they're trapped in a gun room and they need to get out of this spy base we don't really know what it is yet turns out to be an oil tanker but they get out of the uh spy base and they said on the other side of the room you know they did a joke about you want to dance before and didn't really get to dance well they did get to dance actually uh but they do another dance this time as a rehabilitated couple so to speak or a re um you know they've they're back together and it's a wonderful sequence it's fun that's what I'm saying couples will like this movie uh you know they come out ba you know guns or everything and the visuals the smoke is colored they would I don't know why the smoke is purple and pink and whatever it doesn't matter it's just a visual style and it was great and I was like okay that's fun and you know they do the James Bond spy thing you know they've got goggles that they can see them and the other guys don't obviously if if they have the goggles the other guys would have the goggles too there's so many [ __ ] plot holes and then at the very end Brian cranon is like press the button to evacuate the smoke after all of his guys are already dead you know stuff like that but it doesn't matter because we had so much fun now that secet quence was such a Triumph it was so silly they're doing spins they're doing a choreograph dance that would be impossible to shoot all these people simultaneously so it's this huge release and Climax and you're like Bravo well done I'm ready to get the [ __ ] out of here let's go home great film there's more put weight there's more what if we have another battle on the top of an oil tanker the no in the oil room of the oil right I can't even believe I forgot on the bottom forget and it last for like this is the one where I sure everybody dropped off but I said you know what the girls in the audience are going to [ __ ] love this ice skating and I actually I love ice skating I'm a Texan and they have like one ice skating ring out here right Chappelle or whatever it's called and you know I I [ __ ] it up but then I start to get and I have some kind of natural ability and so when I was seeing the sequence I liked it but I could see many people be like man I'm [ __ ] out you can keep it it just can't be 15 minutes long and you have to trim these things down because after a while they start to oversay their welcome they start to retread the same thing cuz she's ice skating she's got knives on her feet and you just go fine it's fine it's dumb it's dumb it's fine it's fine it's fine right she should have done said nobody shoot and then she shoots everyone and then she but like Alex yeah that thank you Joe like Alex said like do do three or four loops she does like 12 Loops it's it it's so long and there's a really cool scenes like she puts a bayonet on a a thing and she jumps and stabs the dude he like this is awesome but then the Scene goes for 10 more minutes it's like [ __ ] stop and then the thing that Joe said at the end it's like okay we we get it oh they call in stop firing it's oil you're going to [ __ ] blow up the whole [ __ ] and they're okay we'll stop firing and then at the end Brian cron sees all of his guys down he's like I don't care just shoot her and I'm like okay I buy that that's fine but nobody ends up but it was just written to allow the good guy to start shooting she must have heard I don't know that she doesn't have the earpiece and nobody shoots at her but she just takes it as it's set for the audience yeah you know and that's what bothers me and then she does the spinning because obviously when you go through all the effort Alex and Joe and audience of setting up this [ __ ] scene and putting all everywhere and and skating you want to do you're like you know what else would be cool if she does one of those spins at the end that we see them all do and she fires but they're like but you already did that I don't care I'm already spending all this money it doesn't take but a five or 10 more minutes and but the thing is it goes a little the difference between a good director and a good editor and a great director and a great editor is when you know the limit and you're like look I know how awesome this is but I've had a bunch of other things that are awesome and I need to pair it down and I agree with you and so she spins around blah blah BL I can't believe I almost forgot about that so then you're out by then and then they come out I'm like all right all right now we good no we ain't good we go on the top of the [ __ ] you know oil tanker and then at the last minute oh we forgot where's the doctor uh you know the doctor uh oh no we're no she goes to go to the little main frame main frame we forgot about that shows up with the shotgun then Argy J lunges at you're right oh my God Joe so there are four going too far things I'm over here thinking there's two going too far things there's actually six we'll count them okay so keep going some people might be out at the go at the [ __ ] dance sequence and I'm like bro if you're out of the dance sequence get the [ __ ] out of the theater you didn't even deserve to be here you're just groud Joo right and then the ice skating it's like okay I can see it went too long maybe now we go to a scene where Brian Cranston is like they won everybody's dead and he's like I got to do it myself I'm like you're Brian cron you're not you're not Thanos but he gets his shotgun and come sneaks up behind him as they're inputting the codes and uploading the data and he goes ha you have to have my eyes to scan it and they turn around he's like now you're dead and just to he monologues for a while and it's just like it does the trophy thing right and you allow these things but you don't allow seven of them in a row right so then the cat this whole cat that it's been a fun thing throughout the whole film it's like are you going is the cat going to do something is it just a CGI effect for fun yes but here the cat jumps out saves uh saves the good guys by scratching him up and I don't buy it I think it's stupid and I love cats as much as an ex person but this was like all right I will allow it again I will allow it because I had fun and oh why your cat scratched his eyes out so now we have to man do the manual upload I didn't even hear them when they said this part because this part is stupid we have to go there's a there's a satellite where we can do it without his eyeballs why even have that so yeah okay so again so then there's another thing right so so you have that so then they go to the top and they're uploading the data from a satellite they realize it's an oil rig and there's just on the like you know uh you know uh in the Titanic that little [ __ ] area the poop deck that's not the poop deck but you know what I mean anyways so then the doctor comes out and she's got the [ __ ] music box because this agent who you know was bad end up killing the uh hacker that got all the information everybody's after and by killing that hacker he had a a explosive setup which blew up she got thrown into the water and when she woke up Brian Cron's character and the doctor manipulator with some psychoanalysis and and telling her that that Brian Cranson is the father and his doctor is the mother and that's what I'm saying I don't really buy Brian Cranson as the villain but I buy him as the dad he does the good Dad yeah he he can do both like I love him in the middle and I loved him in Breaking Bad but he just it's not when he's playing the villain it's like I need more bite from him because I know it's there and it just was kind of he was kind of playing a soft you know kind of thing this is not breaking Brad Brian Cranston this is um squeaky clean kind of thing but anyways so uh the doctor plays this music box and says a few words and Manchurian Candidate Boop activates and she can control his uh you know Bryce Dallas Howard's character and so she starts attacking um you know um Sam Rockwell which I need to get these [ __ ] character names yeah and so like they fight for a long long time and Sam Rockwell quickly realizes he's I I don't want to fight you I don't want to do anything and she keeps you know twisting the CU Anytime the Music Stops she like realizes versus Ellie yeah and he doesn't attack the doctor he doesn't even attt to go over to the doctor he just immediately says you know what I give up throw [ __ ] shoe at the doctor I don't know and then so he just puts he literally puts his hands behind his back and goes I'm not going to fight you and she's going to kill him and she like punches him in the throat and then she's going to she's going to she's going to kill him and then he's I don't they have a reoccurring joke where she smashes heads cuz when she was her Persona of the author and so timid and cute and lovely they he wanted her to smash head heads and they're setting up this scene where she's now that she knows she knows how to smash head she's going to smash his head right then somebody knocks out with a wrench knocks out the doctor it's super unsatisfying instantly she stops and it is extremely unsatisfying go ahead this character out of like out of left [ __ ] field and they kind of sort of like into no but so no I don't want this yes I mean they did no right ins out of left field it's too far it's too buried I mean it's very very buried I mean the the clues are there but like then you're like how the [ __ ] did you get here what is what is this thing and it just it was really like you had a layup and like you had fumbled you had bungled everything for the last half hour and I was like cool we're going to tighten it up now it's going to be over I just hat this and then it just it did wasn't good turn out Kira who you're like who the [ __ ] is Kira I know right apparent you know in the beginning when when they're doing the fun little spy stuff little her story yeah Henry Henry C is doing his spy [ __ ] he's doing like the James Bond stuff and his ride is another agent it's a female agent and it's Kira but as he jumps in uh [ __ ] Dua what's dualipa comes out and she sprays machine gun fire and did you see Henry take a Jeep Wrangler door and and hide behind the Jeep D Wrangler door and then you see all those bullet holes man that door's paper Henry's dead anyways the chick is dead in there and that was Kira and she was an agent well you think oh it's just a throwaway character in a book turns out that everything that the uh Ellie wrote was real and so there was an agent named Kira and it was her friend or whatever and she died in real life and and and and then they do this whole thing with this fan plotline and it turns out that Kira was the fan that sent her the idea of shooting somebody body in the chest with the little hole there that you can survive she said I knew that you had been brainwashed and re and so what I wanted to do was see and then her her motivation is I wanted to see my character come back not I wanted to contact you in some way and know know that you've been you know programmed by the the evil villains none of that stuff and it's like what the [ __ ] wouldn't kir maybe be evil too because she was evil because right and it's like what are we doing here why are we giving Kira a hero moment she hasn't been in the film you're taking away from the characters doing really cool stuff and solving the situation themselves we don't need to be like don't worry the girl didn't die all that Plucky female agent don't worry she's not dead are you okay are you crying what no yeah people die agents die it makes way more emotional impact if she did die everyone on that tanker even the people who weren't like people who were just like running the tanker died they killed they killed everyone they blew up the Death Star there were people that were not you know evil on the Death Star felt like some sort of weird I don't know quota that they had to fill or something maybe they have the they're like hey when we do the prequel series or we do the sequel series or we do she'll be get the [ __ ] out of here yeah I don't know so then they give her credit and she's like I was hiding on the ship the whole time why you told what was your plan I hacked their main frame and I knew that you had been captured and she was captured she's like all right now I got to get over here and help and so when when when we were doing the dance shooting and we could have died you just didn't help at all or if you could hack their main frame and figure all that stuff out couldn't you have leak that information to everyone who needed to get leaked to and no one needed to do this in the first place I I hated this so I understand why people thought it was too much it was too much so that little fight sequence you know what we could keep that little fight sequence we can keep the Manchurian sequence if we shorten it down and then let those two characters Ellie and Aiden resolve it on their own we don't need Kira okay at all at all and so while they're uploading the satellite to give the information to Samuel o Jackson character who was a former director CIA good guy who got out is trying to fight the directive or whatever the bad guy organization is called they finally finish uploading it they save the day and they get out and they go on a boat and they're driving off in the boat and they start kissing and mooching and and then the scene Fades just like the beginning of the movie where she was having these delusions of Sam Rockwell's character turning into Henry Cabell because you know her mind uh I was half expecting to see J by you Alex to see Henry caval and John Cena just start kissing and making out because it turns out I was expecting comedy too like wait cuz he's like I was like okay I wonder if it's there on The Cutting Room floor I don't think they probably would actually kiss maybe they did a fake thing where it came real close and then it turned into the other characters right just for it was fun because nobody knew that it's like well wait a minute so Henry Campell had this partner and he's this big muscle dude where did this guy go if you're writing all the stories and they're all real well it turns out that it was Sam Rockwell that he was the the guy in the Hawaiian shirt just not as muscly but she thought him as strong and so that's why he had big like what thank you you thought of me like he can is genuine in that in those kinds of ways there needed to be a kiss scene a I think it would have been funny uh anyways fun so and then right off into the sunset they have an extra scene where you know since they completed it there's no more missions she even says that in her book and she's writing there's no more missions right off in the Sun and that's her story as well it has become her story and uh and then they do this thing where it's like everybody's happy and it's like what happened to the characters at the end and she's like okay well uh this person G became famous Kira Steve Jobs shut the [ __ ] up Kira is so smart she makes inventions for the directive she started making them for herself well you have to it's [ __ ] Apple cuz Steve Jobs didn't do inventions he I just realized I was like why we have to jerk off the ghost of Steve Jobs because weird inclusion and I forgot that's exactly Apple paid for it so you got to do it jerk them off like oh God it's weird jerk them off more probably definitely required in this grou then Samuel Jackson got some awards medals and [ __ ] and you know everybody lives happily ever after and uh Sam Rockwell's character uh Aiden is still allergic to cats but they're all together the cat's fine and then at the very end uh this other characters like a good question it's like is Henry C only like redneck like a redneck fan dipp in like yeah I got a question mullet you know I I don't have a question for you per se but maybe you'd like to ask me some questions cuz he looks exactly like the AR girl character I don't know what they're implying here I think it was just a funny joke haha he she had met him and he's he's an agent or they're not really going to set anything up if there's a equal with him or maybe they are I think it was just haha he he now the thing is then it ends and then after the credits we we go to a bar this says the king's man they're in the [ __ ] bar and there's this young British [ __ ] who is doing some secret words to the bartender and this bartender [ __ ] is like I understand your language your little gun and it's [ __ ] stupid I don't even know what they're talking about what how does it factor in here I think that's that's the Argy book one you're trying to you're you're trying to tie in The Kingsmen into the Argy Universe into the the author's Argy universe and and I guess saying that this is the young Henry caval as he is becoming an AG and what did you get yourself into and then at the very end it shows a poster it say say the real Argy movie book one coming soon it's like you mean a movie in their Universe like Ellie and Aiden's Universe they're making a movie of it or are you talking about Matthew vaugh starting to make real Argyle movies of the fake Argy in the movie Argyle you're going to start making movies of the fake book that you created for that shut up it's annoying nobody thinks thinks that it's cool and I can't wait for that thing to come out because those are all new actors all new characters nobody gives a [ __ ] about any of them so what are you doing except for sniffing your own farts and it was embarrassing to watch yeah I I mean because Matthew V produces a lot of movies I imagine that he's going to sell this idea to Apple they'll have some brand new director a bunch of all no-name cast people they'll get that girl so Kira comes back it's a TV series yeah so it's got to be I just realized the Apple tiin it's a mother it's going to be like uh the Continental on peacock this is going to be our guy all on it makes sense from Matthew Von's perspective because he gets to sell it he gets produce it like he does all most of his other projects and just sells him an idea and be like hey and that I'll jerk off the ghost of that one too C A young yeah so um yeah H we covered kind of like the third act um anything from the first and the second act no that's a that's a solid yeah so it's like in the first the first the movie you know obviously she doesn't know that she's an agent and Sam Rockwell's not telling her that she's an agent cuz he's like look we eventually find out it's because he worries that her her psyche is is delicate and so he's like hey I need you to predict all of this stuff and like she's like that's stupid and you as the audience are like yeah that's stupid but you just you suspect it's going you suspect it's going somewhere and the payoff actually is is good and so she starts to like piece things together and she's doing it with the the aid of her memory and it's pretty solid and like Joe said the chemistry is there and so the lines are great and when a movie's like and you're thinking to yourself well what about and then the movie says it itself you're like all right I like this it's that kind of good stuff that's in there during that First Act and second act there was one thing I I wanted the the boy so she's an author and she doesn't want you know people hit on her and she's like no I I'm married at my work and I don't have time for that and this and and before the [ __ ] goes down this attractive guy comes I don't know the movie thinks he's attractive I didn't think he was that attractive he got glasses on and he's like hey and he's like a nerd or looks like a a very well-studied man and I was thinking okay she declines him and she's like uh that seat's taken cuz you know she's timid or scared or whatever he's like all right you're lost and he goes on I'm like oh man that guy's going to be an assassin it turned out he was an assassin right or did I miss that no I don't he not assassin in fact at one point he was like hey you're lost again I'm like shut the [ __ ] what are you doing no that guy's your typing is the is yeah yeah that guy is your type is that her husband or something because it almost felt like it's like this is someone it felt weird because it was like he was this character that was injected and they didn't use him in any way no yeah it was just weird I mean they could have just said it you know they they programmed her it's like no love interest cuz it's going to [ __ ] up her plan but okay so that was that was all about that um yeah and then uh they the way they get out of this train is she hugs them tight and they fly off I'm like man [ __ ] like you better had a contingency plan you better not drop Bryce dallis Howard he kill you because if she got scared and she fell I think he reaches around and she passed out yeah I just remember that yeah she passes out so she would have fall off very strong he is um well Sam Rockwell's not that big he's not he's not like a John Cena e like lifts her up in whirly birds like that guy in the movie is built oh so we talk about the whirly bird so at the beginning you seen it in the trailer do do a Lia you know does the got a JJ in your face SP ear muffs man that's and hey look I don't know who that girl is she's a singer or something she is an attractive [ __ ] she's got almost a billion dollars she's like and she's Rich oh crazy Rich she's that attractive and that rich yeah some people man they got it all Jesus [ __ ] Christ okay well you know and and she's supposed to be cuz this is like the stylized fantasy version Henry's super attractive she's super attractive now with that haircut though no no that was really bad like that's what I'm saying is like that this is one of the candidates for James Bond he done know they do him dir they did him dirty is he 40 yet 40 so he's about so James Bond's supposed to be like 40 45 as you get older he he he's getting better so like just do it yeah anyways um but then they do that joke again where it's Sam Rockwell and Bryce Dallas Howard and he gets you know very very jealous I mean they also that they but they do it a third time and it's reversed it's reversed yeah she is holding him up and she's got his crotch in her face you know as he's shooting as you do um yeah but there's uh there's hints that that's all in their head because Brian Cranson is looking he looking at the screen and they're just kind of like awkwardly spinning and so like this is like they're in love they're connecting and it's like okay that's cool it's a it's a m I like that you picked up on that Easter egg that is nice and I was like I wonder if that was intentional because while they're doing this spinning the very next shot is Brian Cranson looking at them on the Monitor and they're just simply they're just like spinning in circles but colors that's either an editing mistake or they were like H people won't notice it or this is a different part or it's actually intentional yeah anyways um yeah anything else uh the cat I was going to say I thought the cat was going to be more more important yeah theer the trailer implied it was all about some kind of secret to do with the cat but well the no that's actually super clever the secret with the cat is Big Argy you know the the name Argy is her she is the secret agent yeah her name Isel Rachel Kyle so that's why they were saying that this cat Argy is the well the cat's name is on Argy cat cat the same name as Samu jacks's character is the same name oh that's right yeah okay well yeah they do a CGI cat multiple times you can't be throwing around real cats like that it just looked fakey it was there for cuteness level um I don't know why the cat had to fly back up and do the stupid trailer shot for the trailer shot and fall back down uh you Sam rock well I got mad at him a few times you know if you're an animal lover you probably gonna get mad a few times he drops the [ __ ] cat just to test to see if there's a a crash uh pad down there and then another time uh they were going to die I mean he's like look that has to be a crash pad or we are going going to die yeah and so he he also knows that she knows more and cat cats can handle it because they're always landing on her feet yeah and then Brian cron shoves the [ __ ] cat off the table when he turns into his evil Persona while faking being the dad and when he's discovered you know he just I heard the audience go they were mad no one abuses but he I mean yeah he does he does knock it off the counter no one is abusing the animal for um I did like the uh [ __ ] we didn't even talk about Kevin McAllister's mom uh home alone uh she did a good job and when she turns from the the mother to the evil British doctor British doctor and may you slow mom what the [ __ ] that was a great little scene there okay anyways going too long I'm trying to make these quick that's why I cut y'all anyways thank you'all so much I think it was great you should watch it just fun entertaining um even see it in theaters help it out help help our boy Henry um if not definitely watch it if it comes out on stream you know what sucks it will come out on streaming but it'll be on Apple I I I'm not going to buy it unless they they're going to have to add like three series I can't believe I didn't cave and do Monarch it's because I knew Monarch was just humans it was like one episode of monsters all eventually see it we got our dose of Godzilla we don't even yeah it's coming it's coming in fact I got a little present downstairs that just got it in so uh it'll make its debut in our Godzilla cross Kong review whenever that movie is supposed to come out thank you guys so much for watching and we will see you on the next Angry Joe show bye guys"
