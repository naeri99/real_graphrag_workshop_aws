  "transcript": "I know people say horror is just about the tits and the gore but God [Music] [Applause] damn what is up everybody and welcome to my review of the original hostle and they kick off to my quick little hostle review series before we land ourselves at 31 on 31 pain and suffering here in just about a week so for those that don't know what 31 on 31 is every single Halloween and sometimes throughout the earlier months of the year me and the cohorts at autop stream get together we choose a theme and 31 franchise films that fit that theme and we rank all of them on Halloween this year we're going to be joined by Rudy at Gen X reviews and with the theme of pain and suffering we've got Hellraiser saw Wrong Turn and of course hostile and hostile is the only one of these films that I have not reviewed yet though I have seen well I saw the first two about to watch the third one tonight and hostile is an interesting movie to talk about for me because the memory of the day I saw this for the first time in theaters with my dad is a memory that will be forever seared into my brain that is a day that I will never forget for as long as I am on this Earth that's not to say that hostile is one of my favorite movies cuz it's not as far from it but the memory of experiencing this movie it's something that both me and my dad remember vividly and when we bring it up both of us just laugh about just the Unison memory that we have that is 100% in line with each other so essentially this movie came out I was a freshman in high school and of course I've always been a horror fan but there wasn't really a whole lot coming out and I had heard some chatter of some people around the high school Halls talking about this movie hostile and I was like that might be worth checking out so it was one of them weekends didn't really have much to do so me and my dad went to go check it out completely blind never watched a trailer never really even knew the premise of it just knew that everybody around school was saying how sick it was and I remember seeing Quenton Tarantino's name on the poster I mean I think Quenton Tarantino's name was even bigger than Eli roths back in the day walked into this sat in a dark theater I think we were the only two there maybe one or two other people there watched this movie almost in complete silence walked out of the theater literally feeling like we just watched a group of people get snuffed like we just walked and paid to see these people murdered actual people and walked out out just kind of numb just like emotionally numb I remember not even speaking as we were like walking through the parking lot to the truck and just like like just a highway hypnosis nothing exists we get into the truck and before we had went to the movie theater I went to Best Buy and I had bought a Seven Dust greatest hits album because I was starting to get into Seven Dust and it was on the song uh too close to hate which is a pretty aggressive song and so we get into the truck and we turn it on we started to drive all a sudden the song cuz too close to hate too close to hate and both of us just went click no Angry Vibes now please put on some [ __ ] Carpenters so now we've set the stage with my first experience with this film and how I felt about it as a young teenager watching this almost 20 years ago and now to talk about what I like what I don't like and what I appreciate about this movie as an adult and as its Legacy has gone on for nearly 20 years but really quick before we talk about all of that if you are

today's sponsorship so starting off with the positives regarding hostile and for me the biggest thing that I will always hold in a positive for this movie is the fact that what Eli Roth set out to do with this film which is to make something that is very shocking very extreme he set out to do that and he achieved that there are very few movies that have ever had any kind of an impact on me with my first experience the way that this one has and while we certainly have continued to go further as far as Gore and things that we've shown on screen that are shocking this movie does seem slightly Tamer than my original memory would have me believe and that just shows how desensitized we have become as a society and as horror fans but this was the most gnarly thing that I had seen up to this point and I'd seen some pretty gory [ __ ] but this was the first movie that to me truly kicked off the era of torture porn I know some people don't like that terminology get over it it absolutely applies to the Hostile franchise not to say that there's nothing that is trying to say beneath all of the gore and the torture but this is absolutely a movie that is trying to just have fullon exploitation levels of Gore and violence and just depravity to shock you to your core and the first time that I saw this it absolutely achieved that going along with all of that I think that this movie does a really good job at preying on that paranoia and that fear of being out of your element and I am certainly one of those people there's not too many things that make me nervous but I do feel more comfortable being in a setting being in a an environment that I at least have some control over or I have enough knowledge to where I know what to do in any given situation and going off to a foreign land with a bunch of foreign people and foreign customs and foreign law enforcement and having language barriers not knowing exactly where you are without directions and maps and help that is a situation that while it should be very fun to go off and be adventurous and to kind of experience new things and broaden your horizons the paranoia side of those things have always been a little bit more prevalent in that idea for me hence why I have yet to venture outside of the United States and this movie completely prays upon that and having these guys go off to these foreign countries and basically get turned into cattle for all of these rich people to take out all their sick desires and Pleasures on and there's few things that I could think of to embody my fear more than that scenario horror films throughout history have completely [ __ ] up situations that should be awesome for all of us you watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre it's like well I don't know if I want to go to Texas and I sure as [ __ ] don't want to travel down any back roads and if I'm ever needing any help I am not knocking on that door of that house you got franchises like Final Destination that make you have even more of a fear of flying and every single time I see one of those log trucks I get way the [ __ ] out of the way and pass them [ __ ] immediately and then you get hostile that now says you're stuck in the US [ __ ] you are never traveling abroad after this I always appreciate a horror film that can Prey Upon somebody's paranoia or pre upon somebody's fears and give the most sick embodiment of what that person was fearing whether it was irrational or not and I think hostile is one of the best movies at achieving that and I also think the way and the pace at which they kind of reveal what is actually going on in this movie as far as the plot and and the situation that these guys are getting themselves in to I think it's done pretty well as far as building tension slowly introducing you to all these different red flags and slowly building this very uneasy feeling of dread to where I mean the first part of the movie is just a bunch of dudes partying a bunch of dudes just hanging out being obnoxious guys and then slowly Oly disappears The King of the Swing you get these ominous little text messages and these pictures that just don't quite look right all the way up to the point where is taken and he wakes up in that chair you feel like something is really not right with this scenario something is not right with this hostile something is not right with this city or this town and even after you see one of the two main characters bite it you get this line of dialogue right at the end where he offers to pay the guy that's going to kill him and he says nobody's paying me I'm paying them and you're like what the hell is going on with that what does he mean by that and then the third act as Paxton is involved in this club and he is trying to escape and he's slow seeing all the different wings and all the different people all the different pieces that are involved with this little Murder Game and this torture game and then gets introduced to the dude from Suits how was it good godamn [ __ ] with this money it better be [ __ ] all the pieces start to fall into place I think they do a good job with that you know the script writing as a whole is not necessarily a home run we'll get into that a little bit but as far as bringing this terrifying scenario to life and slowly revealing to the audience what is actually going on I think they paced it out really well and performance- wise I think all across the board it's pretty solid Jerry Hernandez is somebody I've always seen do pretty good and he's he's good as the main character of Paxton he is somebody that you root for not only because this is a gross situation that looks just unbearably painful so you want him to get out just cuz you're human nature you care about other human beings but he does have enough personality to him and enough of a of a caring nature towards his friends that you endear yourself to him a little bit you got Josh who I've only seen in Dumb and Dumberer and this but he does especially a good job whenever he is being tortured because not a lot of people give enough credit to horror performances a lot of times they just kind of write everybody off that's involved with movies like these as if there's not really any Talent on display and I've always felt like it must take a lot for an actor to go take for take for take trying to elicit this terrified emotion trying to elicit this you know screaming and Howling and drooling and everything without it looking ridiculous and you genuinely feel like this dude is scared for his life whenever he is in this situation and I always try to give credit to that so while he's not nearly as interesting of a character as Paxton which is not a high bar I feel like he does really good on the horror side of things but especially I wanted to point out the guy I think his name is Yan vasic he's a Czech Republic actor so I apolog apologize if I messed up his name but he's the one playing the Dutch businessman who ends up being the one who tortures and kills Josh Sergeant he holds the very essence of life in his hands your life he touches and you get introduced to him whenever they're on the train and he's got this very overly friendly Vibe about him that it's a little too much to where it's offputting and some of that is just being an American you know some of the the friendly customs of other countries and and starting to dive into that whole thing of being a fish out of water and not understanding the way that people interact in other countries he puts his hand on Josh's leg and he freaks the [ __ ] out it's like a homophobic reaction and the guy scurries off and later on they have a nice little conversation at this bar where he saves him from these murderous kids and it builds up an interesting scenario to where when it's revealed that he's the one who's going to take Josh's life it's a bit of a sick little twist there and fun fact that role was originally going to go to ruer Hower I don't know if he was actually uh in the casting process or that's just who Eli Roth had his eye on but they decided to go against an American actor and find somebody that was pretty prevalent in Czech Republic to kind of give a little bit more that authenticity and he does a great job though I do have a burning curiosity of what ruer Howard could have done with that role cuz that seems like a perfect role for that guy and I'll always wonder if that might not have been the better version and finally you got to give credit to the gore this is a movie that's trying to shock you with its extremism and how gory and how depraved and how far they go with the torture stuff and the fact that they keep it pretty much completely practical I don't believe there's any CGI in this it really does help with that authenticity it helps make every single injury that you are watching look real it looks like tendons are snapping it looks like eyeballs are actually hanging out and if you're going to go for that reaction of just making somebody feel sick to their stomach as if they're actually watching people get murdered like me and my dad felt like almost 20 years ago when we saw this in the theaters good practical effects are the way to do that so hats off that they went the full mile moving on to the negatives as I said I really like the premise of this movie I think that it's a creepy setup I think the way that they reveal things throughout the movie has paced out well and has done well they do a pretty good job at executing their narrative that they're going for however the side of the writing that I don't think is so strong is the characters and the dialogue and this is something that I probably would have an issue with in pretty much every Eli Roth film that I have seen and he's very similar to Rob Zombie to me it's somebody that likes to have full creative control he wants to be the one that creates the story that creates his characters that fills him with his style of dialogue and then executes the entire thing as a director and I appreciate that I appreciate that need for Creative control to want to have it be fully your vision the same way that I do with Rob Zombie even though I despise most of his writing it's the same thing here well not quite as cringeworthy as Rob Zombie his dialogue and his characters are what holds back his movies from to me being the best possible version of those films and with Eli Roth to me it tends to be an issue of feeling very immature feeling very much like frat boy styled with the dialogue and with the characters it was an issue I had pretty strongly with Cabin Fever despite liking a lot of that movie and it's brought over to here where just the first third of the movie is kind of like that fully embodied it's a bunch of American dudes that are backpacking through Europe trying to [ __ ] anything that they possibly can and they're high-fiving and they're trying to scheme ways in a girl's pants and they're [ __ ] Eiffel towering chicks with like a silhouette and going into brothel and having three-ways and orgies and stuff and it's just like Jesus like it's to the point where if you put this movie on for the first 30 minutes or so and somebody walks in they're going to be like dude can you at least go in your [ __ ] room and watch this what the hell she's cute but uh we can't rail a girl who's in a com I think that's illegal even in Amsterdam and the dialogue between the characters kind of just enforces all of that I mean when they get kicked out of the broon he's like man this place is just a bunch of a bunch of gay dudes man it's gual to all [ __ ] we got to get out of here [ __ ] you man and it's just that's not the best way to introduce characters that's not the best way to fill out your characters and make us actually care for them that kind of makes me want to see them get a little bit tortured just because I'm annoyed by them those are the types of people that I used to hate being around whenever I was in my 20s and so that always holds back his movies a lot of that does dissipate by the second half once you get into the horror stuff that mostly gets pushed into the background but it's very prevalent in the first half of the film and I could see a lot of people being turned off by it Beyond just the dialogue too there's a number of horror cliches and you I would almost say lazy horror writing that like the tropes that just find their way into this movie in certain spots the biggest one for me is after Josh and oie have disappeared and now Paxton is trying to find them totally understand a worried friends not wanting to abandon a very close personal friend of his in a foreign land and wanting to get down to the bottom of things but when you have a situation where his friends have now disappeared everybody around him is acting like they' never even seen the dude before which had set off a bunch of alarm Bells he finds the two chicks that they've been [ __ ] and they look like a couple of cracked out meth [ __ ] and then they lead him all the way to this aband handon Tor down [ __ ] rubbled filled building and they're like yeah the art shows in there go walk down that long dark hallway you'll see Josh in there have fun what the [ __ ] dude how many red flags do you need bro the only thing missing from that scenario is a big ass sign like with neon saying torture this way and situations like that always take me out of a movie I can be forgiving of minor things or minor stupid decisions because as we all can acknowledge when your adrenaline is up when you're worried when you're you know out of your element as far as being in a horrific situation your brain doesn't always function the same way you can make stupid decisions you can not think clearly but that was like 20 straight minutes of just like dude get the [ __ ] out of there you know better what are you doing those are the moments that pull me out of a movie because I'm reminded that somebody is writing all of this and I don't believe anybody no matter how loyal of a friend they are would ever be in that situation and even though I enjoy this because after you go through the depraved second and third act and seeing all this torture and murder and pain I really look forward to the side of the movie where Paxton starts to get his revenge and all these people that [ __ ] him over and set up his friend and got them killed are starting to get their come upins there's a lot of convenience in the third act there is a lot of convenience first of all just the way that he's able to escape with a number of people that are around there when he goes back in to save the girl and shoots the dude and walks out with her and drives is off and then he got people chasing him and then the kids just happen to be there and then whenever the traffic goes away and he sees the two chicks that let him there that the ones that they were sleeping with he gets on a train it just happens to be the same train that the Dutch businessman is sitting on and again I like seeing all the Revenge that's the side of the gore and the killing that I actually get pumped up for I'm like yeah I'll [ __ ] him up get back at him but I just wish they could have found a way to execute those last 10 to 15 minutes without feeling so contrived but all in all guys hostile is a movie that is interesting because it's absolutely left an impact on me it's a movie I will never forget I will always tell that story and laugh with my dad about how [ __ ] up we felt leaving that film but this is not a horror classic this is not anything that I would recommend to most people that I know and it's not a movie that I ever really care to re-watch very often if I wasn't revisiting it for 31 on 31 I don't know how many years would pass before I eventually Revisited it so it exists it's a movie that I think is done well for what they're going for it's just not an experience that I like to revisit that's it for this one guys if you enjoyed that please click over here for all of my 2023 new release reviews I'm also going to put last year's 31 on 31 that was titled 33 on 31 all

  "refined_transcript": "I know people say horror is just about the tits and the gore but God [Music] [Applause] damn what is up everybody and welcome to my review of the original Hostel and they kick off to my quick little Hostel review series before we land ourselves at 31 on 31 pain and suffering here in just about a week so for those that don't know what 31 on 31 is every single Halloween and sometimes throughout the earlier months of the year me and the cohorts at autop stream get together we choose a theme and 31 franchise films that fit that theme and we rank all of them on Halloween this year we're going to be joined by Rudy at Gen X reviews and with the theme of pain and suffering we've got Hellraiser saw Wrong Turn and of course Hostel and Hostel is the only one of these films that I have not reviewed yet though I have seen well I saw the first two about to watch the third one tonight and Hostel is an interesting movie to talk about for me because the memory of the day I saw this for the first time in theaters with my dad is a memory that will be forever seared into my brain that is a day that I will never forget for as long as I am on this Earth that's not to say that Hostel is one of my favorite movies cuz it's not as far from it but the memory of experiencing this movie it's something that both me and my dad remember vividly and when we bring it up both of us just laugh about just the Unison memory that we have that is 100% in line with each other so essentially this movie came out I was a freshman in high school and of course I've always been a horror fan but there wasn't really a whole lot coming out and I had heard some chatter of some people around the high school Halls talking about this movie Hostel and I was like that might be worth checking out so it was one of them weekends didn't really have much to do so me and my dad went to go check it out completely blind never watched a trailer never really even knew the premise of it just knew that everybody around school was saying how sick it was and I remember seeing Quentin Tarantino's name on the poster I mean I think Quentin Tarantino's name was even bigger than Eli Roth's back in the day walked into this sat in a dark theater I think we were the only two there maybe one or two other people there watched this movie almost in complete silence walked out of the theater literally feeling like we just watched a group of people get snuffed like we just walked and paid to see these people murdered actual people and walked out out just kind of numb just like emotionally numb I remember not even speaking as we were like walking through the parking lot to the truck and just like like just a highway hypnosis nothing exists we get into the truck and before we had went to the movie theater I went to Best Buy and I had bought a Sevendust greatest hits album because I was starting to get into Sevendust and it was on the song uh too close to hate which is a pretty aggressive song and so we get into the truck and we turn it on we started to drive all a sudden the song cuz too close to hate too close to hate and both of us just went click no Angry Vibes now please put on some fucking Carpenters so now we've set the stage with my first experience with this film and how I felt about it as a young teenager watching this almost 20 years ago and now to talk about what I like what I don't like and what I appreciate about this movie as an adult and as its Legacy has gone on for nearly 20 years but really quick before we talk about all of that if you are planning on

today's sponsorship so starting off with the positives regarding Hostel and for me the biggest thing that I will always hold in a positive for this movie is the fact that what Eli Roth set out to do with this film which is to make something that is very shocking very extreme he set out to do that and he achieved that there are very few movies that have ever had any kind of an impact on me with my first experience the way that this one has and while we certainly have continued to go further as far as Gore and things that we've shown on screen that are shocking this movie does seem slightly Tamer than my original memory would have me believe and that just shows how desensitized we have become as a society and as horror fans but this was the most gnarly thing that I had seen up to this

feel more comfortable being in a setting being in an environment that I at least have some control over or I have enough knowledge to where I know what to do in any given situation and going off to a foreign land with a bunch of foreign people and foreign customs and foreign law enforcement and having language barriers not knowing exactly where you are without directions and maps and help that is a situation that while it should be very fun to go off and be adventurous and to kind of experience new things and broaden your horizons the paranoia side of those things have always been a little bit more prevalent in that idea for me hence why I have yet to venture outside of the United States and this movie completely preys upon that and having these guys go off to these foreign countries and basically get turned into cattle for all of these rich people to take out all their sick desires and Pleasures on and there's few things that I could think of to embody my fear more than that scenario horror films throughout history have completely fucked up situations that should be awesome for all of us you watch Texas Chainsaw Massacre it's like well I don't know if I want to go to Texas and I sure as shit don't want to travel down any back roads and if I'm ever needing any help I am not knocking on that door of that house you got franchises like Final Destination that make you have even more of a fear of flying and every single time I see one of those log trucks I get way the fuck out of the way and pass them shits immediately and then you get Hostel that now says you're stuck in the US fuck you are never traveling abroad after this I always appreciate a horror film that can Prey Upon somebody's paranoia or prey upon somebody's fears and give the most sick embodiment of what that person was fearing whether it was irrational or not and I think Hostel is one of the best movies at achieving that and I also think the way and the pace at which they kind of reveal what is actually going on in this movie as far as the plot and the situation that these guys are getting themselves in to I think it's done pretty well as far as building tension slowly introducing you to all these different red flags and slowly building this very uneasy feeling of dread to where I mean the first part of the movie is just a bunch of dudes partying a bunch of dudes just hanging out being obnoxious guys and then slowly Oli disappears The King of the Swing you get these ominous little text messages and these pictures that just don't quite look right all the way up to the point where Josh is taken and he wakes up in that chair you feel like something is really not right with this scenario something is not right with this hostel something is not right with this city or this town and even after you see one of the two main characters bite it you get this line of dialogue right at the end where he offers to pay the guy that's going to kill him and he says nobody's paying me I'm

all the different wings and all the different people all the different pieces that are involved with this little Murder Game and this torture game and then gets introduced to the dude from Suits how was it good goddamn fuck with this money it better be fucking all the pieces start to fall into place I think they do a good job with that you know the script writing as a whole is not necessarily a home run we'll get into that a little bit but as far as bringing this terrifying scenario to life and slowly revealing to the audience what is actually going on I think they paced it out really well

give credit to that so while he's not nearly as interesting of a character as Paxton which is not a high bar I feel like he does really good on the horror side of things but especially I wanted to point out the guy I think his name is Jan Vlasák he's a Czech Republic actor so I apologize if I messed up his name but he's the one playing the Dutch businessman who ends up being the one who tortures and kills Josh Sergeant he holds the very essence of life in his hands your life he touches and you get introduced to him whenever they're on the train and he's got this very overly friendly Vibe about him that it's a little too much to where it's off-putting and some of that is just being an American you know some of the friendly customs of other countries and and starting to dive into

reaction and the guy scurries off and later on they have a nice little conversation at this bar where he saves him from these murderous kids and it builds up an interesting scenario to where when it's revealed that he's the one who's going to take Josh's life it's a bit of a sick little twist there and fun fact that role was originally going to go to Rutger Hauer I don't know if he was actually uh in the casting process or that's just who Eli Roth had his eye on but they decided to go against an American actor and find somebody that was pretty prevalent in Czech Republic to kind of give a little bit more that authenticity and he does a great job though I do have a burning curiosity of what Rutger Hauer could have done with that role cuz that seems like a perfect role for that guy and I'll always wonder if that might not have been the better version and finally you got to give credit to the gore this is a movie that's trying to shock you with its extremism and how gory and how depraved and how far they go with the torture stuff and the fact that they keep it pretty much completely practical I don't believe there's any CGI in this it really does help with that authenticity it helps make every single injury that you are watching look real it looks like tendons are snapping it looks like eyeballs are actually hanging out and if you're going to go for that reaction of just making somebody feel sick to their stomach as if they're actually watching people get murdered like me and my dad felt like almost 20 years ago when we saw this in the theaters good practical effects are the way to do that so hats off that they went the full mile moving on to the negatives as I said I really like the premise of this movie I think that it's a creepy setup I think the way that they reveal things throughout the movie is paced out well and is done well they do a pretty good job at executing their narrative that they're going for however the side of the writing that I don't think is so strong is the characters and the dialogue and this is something that I probably would have an issue with in pretty much every Eli Roth film that I have seen and he's very similar to Rob Zombie to me it's somebody that likes to have full creative control he wants to be the one that creates the story that creates his characters that fills them with his style of dialogue and then executes the entire thing as a director and I appreciate that I appreciate that need for Creative control to want to have it be fully your vision the same way that I do with Rob Zombie even though I despise most of his writing it's the same thing here well not quite as cringeworthy as Rob Zombie his dialogue and his characters are what holds back his movies from to me being the best possible version of those films and with Eli Roth to me it tends to be an issue of feeling very immature feeling very much like frat boy styled with the dialogue and with the characters it was an issue I had pretty strongly with Cabin Fever despite liking a lot of that movie and it's brought over to here where just the first third of the movie is kind of like that fully embodied it's a bunch of American dudes that are backpacking through Europe trying to fuck anything that they possibly can and they're high-fiving and they're trying to scheme ways in a girl's pants and they're fucking Eiffel towering chicks with like a silhouette and going into brothels and having three-ways and orgies and stuff and it's just like Jesus like it's to the point where if you put this movie on for the first 30 minutes or so and somebody walks in they're going to be like dude can you at least go in your fucking room and watch this what the hell she's cute but uh we can't rail a girl who's in a coma I think that's illegal even in Amsterdam and the dialogue between the characters kind of just enforces all of that I mean when they get kicked out of the brothel he's like man this place is just a bunch of a bunch of gay dudes man it's gay as all fuck we got to get out of here fuck you man and it's just that's not the best way to introduce characters that's not the best way to fill out your characters and make us actually care for them that kind of makes me want to see them get a little bit tortured just because I'm annoyed by them those are the types of people that I used to hate being around whenever I was in my 20s and so that always holds back his movies a lot of that does dissipate by the second half once you get into the horror stuff that mostly gets pushed into the background but it's very prevalent in the first half of the film and I could see a lot of people being turned off by it Beyond just the dialogue too there's a number of horror cliches and you I would almost say lazy horror writing that like the tropes that just find their way into this movie in certain spots the biggest one for me is after Josh and Oli have disappeared and now Paxton is trying to find them totally understand a worried friend not wanting to abandon a very close personal friend of his in a foreign land and wanting to get down to the bottom of things but when you have a situation where his friends have now disappeared everybody around him is acting like they've never even seen the dude before which had set off a bunch of alarm Bells he finds the two chicks that they've been fucking and they look like a couple of cracked out meth bitches and then they lead him all the way to this abandoned torn down fucking rubbled filled building and they're like yeah the art show's in there go walk down that long dark hallway you'll see Josh in there have fun what the fuck dude how many red flags do you need bro the only thing missing from that scenario is a big ass sign like with neon saying torture this way and situations like that always take me out of a movie I can be forgiving of minor things or minor stupid decisions because as we all can acknowledge when your adrenaline is up when you're worried when you're you know out of your element as far as being in a horrific situation your brain doesn't always function the same way you can make stupid decisions you can not think clearly but that was like 20 straight minutes of just like dude get the fuck out of there you know better what are you doing those are the moments that pull me out of a movie because I'm reminded that somebody is writing all of this and I don't believe anybody no matter how loyal of a friend they are would ever be in that situation and even though I enjoy this because after you go through the depraved second and third act and seeing all this torture and murder and pain I really look forward to the side of the movie where Paxton starts to get his revenge and all these people that fucked him over and set up his friend and got them killed are starting to get their comeuppance there's a lot of convenience in the third act there is a lot of convenience first of all just the way that he's able to escape with a number of people that are around there when he goes back in to save the girl and shoots the dude and walks out with her and drives off and then he got people chasing him and then the kids just happen to be there and then whenever the traffic goes away and he sees the two chicks that led him there that the ones that they were sleeping with he gets on a train it just happens to be the same train that the Dutch businessman is sitting on and again I like seeing all the Revenge that's the side of the gore and the killing that I actually get pumped up for I'm like yeah I'll fuck him up get back at him but I just wish they could have found a way to execute those last 10 to 15 minutes without feeling so contrived but all in all guys Hostel is a movie that is interesting because it's absolutely left an impact on me it's a movie I will never forget I will always tell that story and laugh with my dad about how fucked up we felt leaving that film but this is not a horror classic this is not anything that I would recommend to most people that I know and it's not a movie that I ever really care to re-watch very often if I wasn't revisiting it for 31 on 31 I don't know how many years would pass before I eventually Revisited it so it exists it's a movie that I think is done well for what they're going for it's just not an experience that I like to revisit that's it for this one guys if you
