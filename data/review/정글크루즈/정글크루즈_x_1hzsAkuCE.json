You guys are excited? We are so excited. The timing of this movie getting released couldn't be better as we are all trying to get on the other side of COVID and everyone is going back to the movie theaters. It's an exciting time. So ladies and gentlemen, I give you the newest, the greatest, and the latest trailer for Jungle Cruise with myself and my co-star, what's her name? Essa? Every? What is it? Actually, I know what it is. It's rhetorical. Hey, ladies and gentlemen, enjoy Jungle Cruise trailer with myself and Ethel Brunt. In theaters around the world in one month. Enjoy.\n\nOf all the jungle cruises you could take in the Amazon, this one is undoubtedly the cheapest, but also the most thrilling. Heads up! Coming through! Look out! Marauders! Natives! Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for, the backside of water. Stays wonder of the world. Anjana, Frankie boy. Mr. Nila, please don't call me that. I'm going to keep your engine. I got my money, then you get it back. Frank gives me money. Please go away. I have a lot of money. We're headed upriver to Lágrimas de Cristal. I gotta be honest, it's not a fun vacation, but you're gonna beg me to turn back. Ten thousand to bring you there. Live? Dead? It's fifteen thousand. Why should I pay more? Dead? Dead I'd have to carry you. That's a lot harder, lady. Here we go. It's impossible."
