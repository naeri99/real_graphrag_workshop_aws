  "transcript": "We begin: *The Way Home*. That's Sang-woo, her daughter’s only son. A face marked by time, like a river etching wrinkles into the skin. We need to go before the last bus stops. Sang-woo’s grandmother is mute. Listen to her and behave yourself, alright? His mom leaves for Seoul to earn money, entrusting him to his grandmother. Ow, that hurts! Ugh... It’s his first time meeting his grandmother. Stupid mute To Sang-woo, she felt like a stranger. The harsh words of a thoughtless city boy don’t wound her. She simply walks ahead, waiting for him to follow. Dinner time. She tears kimchi with her hands and places it gently on his rice. But Sang-woo rejects her touch. She offers him candy, carefully saved in a deep cupboard. Still, he turns his back to her. \"Sang-woo’s dad? We split up a long time ago.\" “She ran off at nineteen with no money at all.” “What do you think she did to survive?” Suddenly, Sang-woo has to poop. It's his first time using a chamber pot. “What are you looking at?” “Where are you going?” Grandma sits beside him, quietly thinking\n about all the years he lived without a father. The next day. A boy from the nearby village stops by. “My mom said you should have this.” “Is that the grandson from Seoul?” “My house is down the hill. You should come by sometime.” “Find the Scavenger Solex!” In the city, Sang-woo was always alone. Making friends wasn’t easy for him. He grew up knowing how to play only by himself. In their tiny room, they revolve around \neach other like the Earth and the Moon. Grandma’s vision is fading. She struggles to see the needle's eye, so she asks for help. Sang-woo threads the needle for her. Then he goes right back to his game. Suddenly, a beetle appears. “Aah! A bug!” “Kill it! Hurry!” To Sang-woo, it was a frightening intruder. “It’s crawling away! Get it!” “I said kill it! Why won’t you?” Without saying a word, Grandma shows Sang-woo how to treat life. She mends her worn-out rubber shoes. Once again, she asks Sang-woo to thread the needle. “Ugh, this is so annoying...” But now he threads it with ease. Then, disaster: the batteries in his game device run out. “Why’s it not working? That’s weird...” “I need new batteries. I need them! Give me money!” But her pockets only hold dust. “I’ll pay you back double when Mom comes.” “What’s that? I don’t even know what that is.” Sang-woo searches the house but finds no money anywhere. He begins to express his anxiety and frustration in a childish way \"Stupid.\" “Rock paper scissors!” “Rock.” While Grandma naps,\n Sang-woo steals her hairpin and dashes off excitedly. “Battery! Battery! Hey, batteries!” He plans to trade the hairpin for some batteries. But this is a remote mountain village. “Batteries?” Finding a shop that sells them isn’t easy. After wandering for what felt like forever, he finally finds a hardware store. But they don’t carry batteries that fit his game. While Grandma is searching for her missing hairpin... Sang-woo considers trading it for snacks instead. But the store owner scolds him harshly, and he runs away in a panic. Soon, he’s lost and crying. Thankfully, an old man passing by gives him a ride back near home. Sang-woo realizes the world doesn’t always go your way… But sometimes, there are kind people who help you when things get hard. And someone who always shows that kindness, no matter what— Grandma. “Where are you going?” This time, it’s Sang-woo who leads the way home. He lies on the wooden floor, lost in thought. Little by little… ever so slowly... Sang-woo’s heart is beginning to grow. The sound of the rain starts to echo inside him. He doesn’t know why—but the moment feels unsettling as the laundry gets drenched.  So he brings it in. The rain stops almost as soon as it began, before his hair even dries. He hangs the laundry back out again. It’s the first time he’s helped with chores. Maybe he feels a bit shy, arranging things as if nothing happened. But Grandma notices what he did in the rain. She gently touches his forehead. She wants to reward her sweet boy with something tasty. “What?” “You don’t have any money…” “Pizza, hamburger, Kentucky Chicken…” “You don’t even know what that is.” “Look! Kentucky Chicken!” “Yes, yes. Bok bok! Chicken!” Grandma sets off, carrying wild ferns to trade for chicken. “Come back soon!” While she’s gone, Sang-woo hides the traces of what he did and falls asleep. Outside, heavy rain pours down. Grandma returns, carrying a live chicken. She prepares a traditional Korean boiled chicken, baeksuk, and offers Sang-woo a tender drumstick. “This isn’t Kentucky Chicken.” \"I said chicken.Who told you to drown it in water?\" “I don’t want it. I’m not eating.” The boiled chicken feels strange to him, and he sulks and goes to sleep. “Ugh, I’m hungry.” Sang-woo didn’t expect 'back-suck\" to be this delicious. But Grandma caught a cold from the rain the day before. Feeling the warmth of the food, Sang-woo starts to act more caring. “I made something. Might be breakfast... or lunch.” Now, he begins to explore the world outside the house. He watches a wild chase with the neighbor kid and a mad cow. “Oppa, just run a little faster!” “You did great. You really did!” Sang-woo pulls a cart loaded with pumpkins. It’s market day. They wait for the bus into town. “Is the bus really coming?” For Grandma, who has no watch, time always moves a little slower. Sang-woo and Grandma arrive at the market. Shy Sang-woo watches her sell goods from behind a wall. Even if she sells everything, it’ll only make a few thousand won. “They fit perfectly!” Still, she uses that money to buy her grandson new shoes... And even treats him to a bowl of jjajangmyeon. \"2,300 won, please.\" Looking back and forth between Grandma and the money, Sang-woo passes by a store that sells batteries... but keeps walking.  Batteries Grandma checks inside the bus to see if she recognizes anyone. “Is this not the right one?” The truth is—Grandma can’t read. “Yes, this is the one. Go ahead and get on.” “Someone asked me how you’re doing. You should go see them sometime.” Grandma plans to visit her old friend who runs a small shop. Meanwhile, Sang-woo is a little distracted by a local girl. “She keeps asking what I want to eat...” “Choco Pie.” Grandma picks up a Choco Pie wrapper and heads to her friend’s place. “You’re here?” “Your knees? Same as always.” “So your grandson’s come, huh?” “Choco Pie?” “Two of them?” \"Here, take one more. Of course.” “Leave it.” “Hey, leave the veggies too.” “Oh no, please. We’ll enjoy them.” “My knees hurt too much to go out.” “Let’s meet again before I die.” “It’s called ‘Rabid Rabbit’ or something.” Sang-woo takes the Choco Pies from Grandma \nand heads to the back of the bus. “Don’t worry, Grandma. I’ll make sure we get off together.” But Grandma doesn’t get on. She asks Sang-woo to take their things. “Isn’t Sang-woo’s grandma getting on?” “She said she’ll finish her errands and come later. Told us to go ahead.” “Wow, you really understand your grandma well.” Sang-woo arrives first and waits for her to return. \"This one’s for tomorrow.\" Sang-woo returns home, then heads back out to the bus stop. Grandma walked all the way, carrying the luggage, just to save on bus fare. “Why are you so late?” Sang-woo takes the bags and secretly hides a Choco Pie inside. Since he broke the chamber pot, Sang-woo now has to use the outdoor toilet. “Aren’t you coming?” “Where are you?” “Stay there, okay?”  “Don’t fall asleep.” A toilet with no light. Just darkness Grandma becomes his firefly. “Sang-woo, Chul asked where you live and even stopped by your place.”  A neighborhood girl invites him over—he melts with giddy nerves Wanting to look good, Sang-woo checks himself in the mirror.   his hair’s gotten long, and he’s not sure it looks cool So he asks Grandma to trim it just a little. Her hands are so gentle, his eyes slowly close… “Is it done?” “What… what is this?!” “Who told you to cut it this much?! Ughhh!” Grandma carefully wraps something with love  Sang-woo covers his head with Grandma’s cloth, getting ready for a date.  “That’s so lame.”  He rides with toys in hand, heading to meet the girl.\n  “Gosh, don’t bring useless stuff like this. It’s embarrassing.” The date must’ve gone well—Sang-woo returns smiling,\n  But on the way back, he gets into an accident. Limping home: “Mad cow!! It’s a mad cow!”\n  He thought it was a joke…   But there really was a mad cow charging at him. At the brink of danger, He’s saved thanks to an older boy in the neighborhood.  “Sorry about last time.”\n  He walks home in tears. Sang-woo unwraps the toy box. Inside, he finds 2,000 won. From picking bracken to growing pumpkins, She saved even the bus fare, all for her grandson. Every hello comes with a goodbye A letter came from Mom. It was a letter saying they'd come pick up Sang-woo soon.\n  “Okay, read this again carefully.”\n  “This one says ‘I’m hurt.’ And this one, ‘I miss you.’” “Now, write it.” Sang-woo teaches his illiterate Grandma two precious words. “You can’t call me… and you can’t even write.\nThen how will I ever hear from you?” “If you get really sick, don’t write anything. Just send the paper.” “Then I’ll know it’s from you, and I’ll come running right away.”  “Okay ? Promise?”  Tomorrow is the day he leaves. While Grandma sleeps, Sang-woo prepares his final gift. “Eat well, okay?” “I’ll try to come again before the New Year. \"Sang-woo, anything to say to Grandma?” “He’s probably just shy.”  Sang-woo can’t even look Grandma in the eyes. He says nothing as he boards the bus. He hands over the gift he prepared the night before. As the bus pulls away, he speaks his heart in Grandma’s language.
