Beautifully. l haven't seen either of them\nin nine years. Think maybe we should go see them? No, l don't think maybe we should go\nsee them. Thanks for the interest, though. The job must have been tough on them. -l didn't do this then.\n-What did you do? -l was a cop.\n-You were a cop in Chicago? Then you must know\nall about Jimmy Serrano. Do you have the right\nto ask these questions? -l think l do.\n-No, you don't. -l think l do.\n-No, you don't. Why not? Dinner 's over. Let's go. l can see this is gonna be some fuckin' trip. l wouldn't worry about it.\nl won't be with you much longer. What do you mean? With what l know about Serrano,\nif l go to jail l'll be dead within 24 hours. So sooner or later,\nl'm gonna have to give you the slip. Glad you find it humorous. -Let's go.\n-$2? That's all you're gonna leave? -That's 15 percent.\n-That's 13 percent. These people depend on tips for a living.",
