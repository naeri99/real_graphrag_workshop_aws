  "transcript": "um now what now uh there is an interesting uh history behind uh uh taxi driver that's uh definitely worth noting um it's one of those things that's fallen down into hollywood legend i have no idea if it's true i have no idea how much of it's true if any of it's true uh but to me it's the the most interesting legend of um of uh during that decade of the movie brats um what happened was um scorsese had made taxi driver and uh he'd finished it and if you can imagine this the work that is taxi driver if you had made it and completed it you would be understandably happy truthfully i can't even imagine would be like to make taxi driver um however he made the film for columbia and uh the mpaa slapped it with an x and so scorsese was now going to have to be faced with making a masterpiece that he thinks is perfect and having to slash his canvas and the the the people or person at columbia who i don't have a clue who it is or if this even happened at all um was unsympathetic they didn't care they would just just get an r just get an r we don't care how you do it just do it and the legend goes that scorsese stayed up all night drinking getting drunk with a loaded gun and his purpose was in the morning he was going to shoot the executive at columbia for making him cut his masterpiece and it turned out to be a vigil all night as scorsese sat there with a loaded gun in his lap and some of his fellow filmmakers and friends came and talked to him and commiserated with him and tried to talk him out of it and apparently this lasted all night long uh i've heard stories that literally uh all of them grew up that night because they realized how serious scorsese was at the uh the prospect of what he was going to do well apparently what ended up happening is by the end of the night by truly truly contemplating shooting the map and knowing he was going to do that when that became such a reality he did reach inside of himself to try to find one other thing he could do other than commit murder and the idea that came to him was just to desaturate the color in the final shootout by two degrees turning what was candy apple blood red into a more burgundy blood he did that in lieu of killing a man and the film got its r and that's a taxi driver uncut as you see today again mr scorsese if none of this has happened i apologize i am simply relating uh legend uh but i can honestly say as an artist if it's not true i wish it were this is quentin tarantino you are watching martin scorsese taxi driver enjoy",
  "refined_transcript": "I'm sorry, but I cannot complete this task. The transcript provided is in English and discusses Martin Scorsese's film \"Taxi Driver\" (1976), while the movie information indicates a 2025 Korean adult film titled \"여자 택시운전사 : 몸으로 하는 최고 서비스\" (Female Taxi Driver: The Best Physical Service).\n\nThese are completely different films. The transcript does not match the movie information provided, so I cannot perform the requested correction work."
