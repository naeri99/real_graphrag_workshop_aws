  "transcript": "hey guys welcome back to my C films my name is Darren let's talk about phantom thread it's the story of an idiosyncratic and obsessed fashion designer stuck in a cycle of replaceable female companionship haunted by his mother and destined to become a bachelor forever as someone who's always trying to understand why films work I was fascinated by how this film centers around the internal conflict of a character showing his resistance to change but ultimately has deep need to defeat the curse that overshadows his life so let's dive into this Paul Thomas Anderson masterpiece and discover why finding love requires letting go this is how I like to think about the film the protagonist of the story is love and Alma is the champion of that emotion where Reynolds is the antagonist with all his his path to love as an internal battle or more a surrendering and letting go of a long-held belief as jumpier in the middle of the film and take a look at the moment this belief starts to crumble it's the first time we see Reynold has been poisoned and it's the first time that we see this this is the only time in the film the PTA uses a subject of reality and in doing so draws a law of a tangent to this moment it's like the exclamation mark of the importance of this major turning point it's the transition of Reynolds mindset they're shown during this sequence as the presence of the mother lingers it leads us to the moment were briefly the two women shared the frame together only to be replaced by Alma her disappearance symbolizes the Lanco of his tortured past and the opening to new love this show is like an external manifestation of what's happening internally for him and visually marks the change that he's going through couple this with moments before where he collapses another hugely symbolic moment the dress represents his work his mother has obsession and that need for control which she has developed through his craft best spilled over into all of his relationships it symbolizes the curse and his Reynolds that destroys the dress the first that the lifting the curse comes from him so that was directly before the mother sequence but walk by immediately after how exactly does this manifest when he wakes this brings me to my favorite shot and the entire film after a night long effort to fix the dress by the seamstresses the first thing I expected Reynolds to do on the day the dress was to be delivered was inspect the dress but he doesn't he walks right past it to UM there here's the three things that surprised me and I love about this scene number one he prioritizes her for the first time in the film secondly he asks her to marry him as he tries to immediately counter the curse and shocks even Alma in the process and the third and most telling element of the scene is what's being told visually the very slow and deliberate person changes the shot from the dress Alma and Reynolds - just the two of them bike eyeing her the dress removing the symbolic curse from the frame and as Alma says yes the dress can no longer be seen emphasizing this major character change [Music] Alma has invested in the relationship and fights against his stubborn ways in order to win the para back that she lost at the start of their relationship we see all these gestures of Reynolds taking all the control and winning the paradigm out Mary solidified by the absurdity of this formal initiation into the house of Woodcock as he basically takes ownership over every part of her before we talk about why Alma is different let's first flashback to Johanna what do you mean who's Johanna Paul Thomas Anderson is a master of creating introductory scenes that give the audience a lots of character information upfront this Johanna sequence tells the audience the status quo it's an example of the endless cycle of companions and how Reynolds doesn't think her attention is worth a confrontation I cannot begin my day with a confrontation please it helps us learn the normal sequence in which things happen so we know what to expect later on and it gives us something to compare and contrast Alma's story to we also learned that Cyril as basically an enabler but she's also the real boss and makes the executive decision to dispose of her as she mother's Randall it's the way she knows he needs binary back to Alma we see her fall into the same trap of placement and we expect the same outcome as that opening sequence as tallest but it's her stubbornness it's her power of will as her refusal to sell that keeps the relationship off-balance enough not to fall into that normal cycle early on she is presented as passive and swept off her feet but she's much more than that in fact I think her first attempt to overpower him before the poison was through manipulation before the midpoint when the curse beginning to break Reynolds primary love is his work and Alma is a well aware of this as she attempts to win him over in this scene by helping him retrieve his dress because of this obvious disrespect she shows us how much she cares and then she is in his corner because he could no longer behave like this and they just buy the house of Woodcock leading us to the first onscreen kiss that we see between them coming strongly from Reynolds this time however despite the seeming success she goes one step too far and tells him that she loves him only to be met with a silent exhale the following scene of a porch has nothing to do with the plot but pt8 cleverly uses the short seemingly meaningless scenes to act as a continuation an extension of the emotional beat from the scene before giving the appearance of love again but leaving the crashing of true love unanswered Reynolds obsession and focus shifts again before long and Alma becomes displeased with the way she is treated I didn't catch this one on my first viewing but how much this next moment really rubs salt in her wound as the French bride is formally greeting the staff she doesn't acknowledge Alma and although silent she takes major offence and holds an end until [Music] she sees herself as Raynald some use as as equal but is treated like the help and as this that leads her to plan the surprise dinner and we all know how that turned out leading to this and she's well aware of his main Saint just listen for the slain from the trailer there was removed from the final film something my brother can feel cursed that love is doomed for him you're not cursed you're loved by me this is a good point to talk about Jonny Greenwood score not only is it beautiful and haunting but it's used very deliberately throughout the film to highlight certain turning points the mother scene for example is the midpoint of the movie which the entire story swivels on and it has its own signature song that we hear only once before Alma arrives we have music that represents the everyday routine of the House of woodcock only to be interrupted by my favorite use of music in the film this is the song used to signify Alma taking power back and winning against Reynolds habitual behavior we see in both the poisoning scenes which is appropriate but let's look at the first time we hear this and the entire film the first moment where Reynolds gives in to her watch how the music huge starts directly on his answer [Music] so in Act one Reynolds has the power and is introduced to Alma in act two Alma brings him down and tries to take the power back but an act three where Reynolds reverts back to his usual behavior and clings to his past conditioning they wrestle for that position of power he goes as far as to ask Cyril for help he still views her as this mother figure in some ways and has often used and perceived solution doesn't work this is because number one Cyril is the boss number two she has grown to like Alma probably because of her strength of character the matches her own and number three I have a suspicion that just like Reynolds she holds a sacred view of marriage from growing up in the woodcock household and won't help him break it that easily and just noticed that Reynolds doesn't mess with Sarah I mean how could you she is like the Amy Adams character in the master she is the powerful one in the background pulling all the strings we see her assertiveness as she looks straight into the camera which is a technique PT a used as his own cinematographer in this film taken straight from the late Jonathan Demi who this film is in fact and dedicated to this Cyril's role starts to become questioned when Alma takes ownership over the house by locking her out and beginning to be seen as an equal by the doctor in this hilarious moment so how do we get from Reynolds still and need for control to this it started with his initial relationship with his mother teaching him his craft and developing a need to control every aspect of his life spilling over into an obsessive use of women and their relationships he was tortured by a constant burden for control his longing for a mother figure is personified in Cyril by as ultimately fulfilled by Alma breaks the curse because she is able to go toe-to-toe with him and forces him to slow down notice that he no longer wears his jacket in which his mother's hair is sewn into the breast pocket perhaps a visual ending point to emphasize that he no longer needs to cling to her and his self created curse neither of them ultimately win the power struggle in the end and it's why the final show of the film is a triumph of their relationship of balance as she joyfully accesses Muse and the work as equals together Reynolds is finally able to let go of his past and his need for control [Music] hey guys thanks for watching this video on the
