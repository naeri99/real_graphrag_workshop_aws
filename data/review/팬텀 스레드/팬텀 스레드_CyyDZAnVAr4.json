  "transcript": "phantom threat was directed by Paul Thomas Anderson and stars Daniel day-lewis and his supposedly final role and I am clearly not in my normal set I'm actually in LA right now with my wife we for the very first time ever received an invite to the Critics Choice Awards which is happening tomorrow and we're gonna get to go to that which is kind of nuts I've been trying to become a member of the broadcast Film Critics Association for many years I've actually been emailing them for two years and I finally got a bit of a response and on Thanksgiving Day last year actually I found out that I was officially approved which was really awesome Thanksgiving present and that means I get to go the Critics Choice Awards every year which is really cool and yeah so that's why I'm here in LA we're doing that and since I was here I was like got to see phantom thread because that hasn't opened yet in Ohio and I really wanted to see it and I got to see it in 70-millimeter which is even cooler and this film is about a meticulous dressmaker in 1950s London played by Daniel day-lewis who meets a woman named Alma who becomes at first his muse eventually his lover and problems eventually arrives because Daniel day-lewis is character Reynolds is a very serious artist I wouldn't really say he views himself as a fashion designer he probably views himself more like an artist he will sit with his notepad in the mornings and try to create dress ideas and if you chew your food improperly or make too much noise or speak to him when he doesn't want to be spoken to or in any way disrupt his routine his entire day is lost so this creates a lot of difficulty for Alma because she wants to be loved in the same way that she's loving him she feels like she would love to take care of him and be there for him whenever he would need her but he doesn't need her that much or at least he doesn't act like he does he's the type of artist that needs human interaction just like all artists do we all need to connect and feel like we're going back and forth with someone else about ideas and that's one of the best ways to create when you're in a mood like no matter what your art is if you're a painter sculptor a filmmaker a writer going back and forth other people about your ideas or their ideas can be really creatively inspiring but Reynolds doesn't like to admit that he needs that and so he likes to have people situated in his life like they're a chess board of sorts like you go there and that's where you belong and this person here belongs there and as long as you move and the way that I know you always move I'm going to be satisfied that's the way he views life which creates a lot of problems for them in their relationship phantom thread is a movie that some will consider boring because nothing really happens there's very few large sequences where you feel like something huge is happening as usual Daniel day-lewis is incredible in this movie saying that he's great in a movie is kind of like saying a studio ghibli film has amazing animation no but he really does disappear behind all of his characters you recognize that it's him because he's famous but there is no Daniel day-lewis performance where you're like yeah that's that's him because he just disappears you can look at some of even Robert De Niro's performances and be like all right he's he's being DeNiro you can't really do that with Daniel day-lewis that's why he's so terrific and one of the best actors ever but since the film is slow moving I can understand why anyone would think the film is boring there are some really great sequences one of my favorites when a woman who is very wealthy who has put a lot of money into the house that day-lewis lives in she wants a dress made for her she is not the type of woman in his mind that he would prefer to make a dress for she gets drunk a lot she doesn't have a very good reputation the more the best scenes the film is when he has to sit at this party and watch her get drunk and stumble around in his dress and you can just tell that he is seething with anger because this art that he's created for her that she is wearing she's tarnishing it and it's one of the better sequences in the film now towards the end of the movie a character makes a choice to sort of accept something and it's going to work for some and it's going to not work for some this is the type of decision that a great filmmaker will make great filmmakers like Paul Thomas Anderson they they take risks they have something in the movie that is a gamble where it could go both ways and I'm not entirely sure if it worked for me there are legitimate seeds planted leading up to this choice and in retrospect you look back and you think about his life his past particularly with his mother who he speaks of a lot and you started to think maybe this makes a little bit of sense but it didn't know how to present work for me because I didn't really feel like character wise it was justified it did feel kind of out of left field besides that I was mostly riveted by this movie because of the incredible work from both Daniel day-lewis and the actors who portrays Alma who I believe her last name was pronounced cripes Vickie cripes Vicki creeps not entirely sure how to pronounce her her last name but she was marvelous as well and it's just filled with amazing performances and it's a very piercing look at the way an artist with a very straightforward narrow mentality has a difficult time accepting others into his life and the toll that it takes on those around him that do care about him I'm gonna give phantom thread a B+ guys thank you so much as always for watching I really appreciate it and thank you for continuing to support my endeavors over the years through film and the various things I've tried to do it really honestly means a lot to me the fact that I get to go to the Critics Choice Awards tomorrow it's kind of crazy to me because for a long time I would just look on the computer or on my phone at events like that and think that's never gonna be something I'm gonna be able to go to and I it's just kind of nuts that I'm gonna be able to go to this awesome ceremony that I've heard about for years and I get to bring my wife and we're invited and it just feels awesome it's and I owe that to you guys for for watching and supporting me over all these years so thank you so much guys if you liked this you can click right here and get starmon eyes [Music]",
