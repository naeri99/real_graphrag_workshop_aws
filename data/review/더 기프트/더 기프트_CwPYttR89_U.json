  "transcript": "[Music] there are many films that leave you feeling empty inside a sense of uncertainty that lingers long after the credits in the opening moment of the gift the film reinforces this point with its desolate atmosphere i don't feel trapped watching it i feel much like the characters settled into a wide open neighborhood peaceful and undisturbed but somehow with a sense of absence joel edgerton made a supremely subversive directorial debut that manages to make the most calm and friendly environments seem like a nightmare the visuals initially convey the loving relationship between simon and robin but the way the maze on scene and cinematography work together to imply a sense of emotional distance between the couple gradually establishes the conflict driving them apart the composition maintains the desolation surrounding simon and robin as they are continuously framed within wide spaces that make them seem distant from their unfamiliar environment this shot for example begins with deep focus and switches to shallow depth of field to frame gordo watching from a distance to establish the film's very hitchcockian sense of tension in fact the camera is always free and predominantly distant from its characters in a very voyeuristic way as if we're stalking on their lives this couple are always exposed they look like outsiders whether it be the minimalist decoration that accentuates them are the large windows that surround their house the couple are largely oblivious to how vulnerable they are in this seemingly innocuous time inhabited by friendly people including gordo hey thank you for the lovely gift that was very sweet but i'm sure that you spoke to simon about that i know it's only when simon's conflict with gordo intensifies does the film take a tonal shift towards darkness and isolation suddenly the couple's lives aren't fueled by mild discontent but rather paranoia and this unnerving sense of danger but we experience this transition through the perspective of robin who has become trapped and even alienated from those around her especially simon who seems to be unconsciously controlling her his dominance within the household is recognized but isn't forced it's organically developed as her emotions and insecurities come second place to his i'll take an apology for that oh this is not about an apology simon this is about you and me you have to do this for us because if you don't at least try to fix this if you don't shh their love still exists but her freedom feels restricted especially with simon's insistence to start a family which robin is accepting off but never seems satisfied with the idea in fact when the tension in their relationship is addressed simon places the blame on gordo which is relatively true but for very distinct reasons it's made apparent that gordo is seeking retribution for simon's bullying and the distressing lies that led gordo to nearly being murdered by his own father for allegedly being homosexual resulting in gordo's traumatized childhood and the arrest of his father gordo's intent is to emotionally manipulate the couple against each other he turns robin against simon as she becomes gradually disillusioned by simon's increasingly sinister behavior earlier in the film simon tells robin that while everyone changed gordo stayed to see him yet later while blaming gordo for being stuck in a moment feeling sorry for himself the reality becomes clear that simon hasn't changed either you're a bully you are then and you still are now he's still a bully and this becomes realized in his pressure towards his wife cheating dany out of a job through fabrication and forcing gordo to accept an insincere apology in fact simon's school friend greg summarizes the entire point of the conflict it's amazing how an idea can take a hold really bring a person down that line best encapsulates the thematics of the film there is this emphasis on how looks can be deceiving but fundamentally we have this natural tendency to generalize assumptions without knowing the full picture we see this in both simon and gordo's performances jason bateman does make us sympathetic of simon initially but there is a constant stress that begins to overwhelm his character as the film progresses and simon's attempts to maintain his mature composure gradually dissipate it's subtly conveyed while joel edgerton's gordo comes off as naturally quirky eccentric socially awkward and even a little dimwitted but he's not a sociopath by any stretch of the imagination despite the way simon and robin begin to perceive him he might be going through a midlife crisis considering his obsession with high school and attempts to look younger with the dyed hair and earring but even robin's lack of career progression and simon's jealousy for working with young billionaires and wanting to get to the top before he's too old carries this lingering feeling of regret of not having a more fulfilling life you're done with the past the past is not done with you i what what do you mean by that gordo however is playing a character so his oddities are deliberate and the couple's growing concern towards him are part of his meticulous strategy to devolve the couple's relationship in fact this line insinuates gordo's plan but you know i believe that a lot of the good could come from the bad you know i hear you if you put the right faith behind it you know not to bring religion into it god but well just to say that the the bad things they can be a gift he embeds cryptic religious metaphors into some of his notion calling on the idea that bad things can help redeem or destroy a person who is of guilt which in this case is simon in this story however simon omits guilt he never blames himself for anything even after losing his job his wife and left with the burden of not knowing if it's his child or gordos simon never seeks that redemption and the film concludes with gordo watching to see how simon reacts to the gift that gordo has given him since simon remains in denial of his mistakes at least where the audience last see him gorda walks away taking off his arm sling to imply that he is now free of his own burden which calls upon two biblical versus gordo leaves on simon's car luke chapter 3 verse 9 states that the axe is already at the root of the trees and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire in one interpretation it's a judgment call in which unfruitful individuals will be cast aside while those more deserving will prevail which reflects the outcome of the events then in psalms chapter 7 verse 15 states that whoever digs a hole and scoops it out falls into the pit they have meid a verse which is again very much indicative of simon's actions when gordo reveals his true cunningness he leaves simon with the consequences of poisoning minds by using the same action against him gordo poisons the minds of both simon and robin he uses his injuries and humbleness to get robin to sympathize with him while psychologically scarring simon over whose baby it is it's all in the eyes he says but as the film switches to simon's point of view he never attains an answer and is left completely distraught just to reinforce this confusion notice how simon never has an opportunity to handle the baby and when looking for answers his eyes are directed from the bb onto his wife in my eyes gordo didn't rape her it's out of character and he's clearly intelligent enough to cover his tracks let alone and risk embedding his dna onto robin with simon left as a broken man gordo leaves robin with a false sense of assurance that the baby is gordos to make her feel more content with her child again using simon's constant lies to gordo's benefit the previous verse of psalm 7 states that whoever is pregnant with evil conceives trouble and gives birth to disillusionment the disillusionment that robin fell towards simon is negated by this uncertainty robin doesn't feel she carries the burden of simon's failures but rather the humility of gordo [Music]",
