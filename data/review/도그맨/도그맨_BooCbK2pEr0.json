  "transcript": "Hello. This is Zakza Misang The title of the movie I’m introducing today is… ‘DogMan (DogMan.2024)’ The 2018 Italian film of the same name is also good, but today it's Luc Besson's 'Dogman' There are spoilers until the end The subtitles that appear when the movie starts are impressive ‘Wherever there is misfortune, God sends the dog’ - This is a quote from French writer Alphonse de Lamartine The movie begins by sending the message that 'GOD' and 'DOG' are just reversed spellings That's why there's this version of the poster A woman driving a large truck is arrested by the police This suspicious woman has no ID or vehicle registration. She looks like Kang Ho-dong dressed up as a woman, and her big butt looks like she could blow away one or two police officers When the police opened the truck door, inside were... dozens of dogs? A transvestite now temporarily detained in the police station holding cell. His name is Caleb Psychologist Jojo is brought in to investigate Caleb The story now unfolds from Caleb's childhood Caleb lives with his violent father, who makes a living as a dog fighter Caleb was locked up in a dog pen just because he fed dogs His older brother, Torai, was only his father's right-hand man, and his kind but powerless mother felt sorry for Caleb and eventually left home Caleb thrives on the company of dogs who trust and rely on each other through their eyes and warmth, even if they don't communicate verbally, rather than on the family that shares his blood with him Then one day, he gets shot by his father and loses his little finger, and the bullet gets lodged in his spinal cord, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down His father committed suicide after being sentenced to 20 years in prison, and his older brother was mauled to death by dogs on the day he was released after serving a 12-year sentence It's interesting how Caleb tells Jojo what virtues only dogs have that humans don't Beauty without vanity, strength without arrogance, courage without cruelty, Yet the dog has one flaw, and that is... 'he trusts humans' He dresses up as a woman and sings on stage, he beats up gangs that harass good people, and he shares the wealth of rich people who don't even know how much money they have with the help of dogs... among the dogs Then, he is eventually attacked by a gang, and Caleb, who kills the gang with his dogs, is finally saved with his dogs under the shadow of the cross The heart of this film is a truly outstanding performance by Caleb Landry Jones He has already worked with world-class directors such as the Coen brothers, David Fincher, Brandon Cronenberg, Neil Jordan, John Boorman, Roland Emmerich, Jordan Peele, and Sean Baker, but I don't think I've ever seen him take on a solo lead role in an entire film, except for 'Antiviral (2012)' The fact that this film was directed and written by Luc Besson was a factor in its success in the 90s, but unfortunately, it is closer to the opposite now His talent, which seemed like it would shine forever in the 90s when every one of his works became a global mega hit like ‘Le Grand Bleu (1988)’, ‘Nikita (1990)’, ‘Léon (1994)’, ‘The Fifth Element (1997)’, etc., has recently become a routine production where the basic setup itself is good but something seems to be 5% empty, and it seems like he has been doing the same thing for 20 years, going from being successful to falling into ruin Nevertheless, this movie is definitely worth the two hours just for the performance of Caleb Landry Jones He gives a performance that seems to claim the lead role in the next 'Joker' movie as his own And it's a great pleasure to watch puppies put on an outstanding performance In this film, the chanson ‘Non, Je Ne Regrette Rein’ (I don’t regret anything) which was impressively featured in the beloved film ‘Nobody Loves Me (1995)’ that I reviewed and ‘Inception (2010)’ appears as a very important element in which the lyrics themselves replace Caleb’s lines And then there's Eurythmics' 'Sweet Dreams' and Miles Davis' 'So What' They're all really, really great songs However, since it was a song that had been used so many times here and there, I felt regretful that it was necessary to use it again in this work Because the intention of the lyrics and title becomes too obvious However, the film's production quality, including its cinematography, editing, and sound, is of course excellent, and above all else, once again, Caleb's performance is outstanding If the second half of the scenario had been a little more novel, this work could have been ranked as a masterpiece The main character's character, which was well-built from the first half to the middle, gradually lost strength in the second half and the development became predictable, so I personally found the second half very disappointing Nonetheless, this is a very watchable piece I highly recommend it The film has an IMDB rating of 6.8, a critics' rating of 59, and an audience rating of 83% on Rotten Tomatoes As of November 2024, it is available on U+ Mobile, Coupang Play, Wave, YouTube, Watcha, Naver Series On, Genie TV, and B TV That was the review of ‘DogMan (DogMan.2024)’ To all of Zakza Misang's subscribers, I hope that you are healthy in body and mind during these difficult times, and that even your bank account is healthy and prosperous This was Zakza Misang",
