  "transcript": "foreign [Music] Central Computer provides this state-of-the-art robot with new programs daily the Nestor class 5 is tomorrow's robot today foreign [Music] [Music] relax relax I'm a police officer all right ma'am is that your purse of course it's my purse I left my inhaler at home he was running it out to me I'm sorry for this misunderstanding officer don't apologize you're doing what you're supposed to be doing but what do you do homicide Spooner okay [Music] good to see you again son hello doctor everything that follows as a result of what you see here is there something you want to tell me I'm sorry my responses are limited must ask the right questions why did you call me I trust your judgment normally these circumstances wouldn't require a homicide detective but then our interactions have never been entirely normal in jukri at that right is there something you want to say to me I'm sorry my responses are limited you must ask the right questions why would you kill yourself that Detective is the right question program terminated [Music] NADA those security locked from the inside Wham splat guys a jumper for sure Robertson I don't think anyone saw this coming you know and I should have I suppose I knew him 20 years and Alfred practically invented robotics he wrote The Three Laws but hell as soon as that you got one maybe I'll look around ask a few questions and do the whole cop thing you know I'll send someone to escort you thank you very much possible really okay so would you say that Dr Landing was suicidal you would seem to answer that question as a parent that's not what I asked you no I wouldn't have thought so but obviously I was wrong 24-hour surveillance obviously company policy where the feeds sensor strips everywhere but the service areas they link to a positronic operating core is you wouldn't get a building a brain she was actually landing's first creation good day Vicki designed most of Chicago's protective systems I have decreased traffic fatalities by nine percent this year alone oh thanks show me inside the lab from one minute prior to the window break [Music] authorized entry so Dr Calvin what exactly do you do around here my general fields are Advanced Robotics and Psychiatry although I specialize in Hardware to wet wear interfaces in an effort to advance usr's robotic anthropomorphization program so what exactly do you do around here I make the robot seem more human [Music] what in God's name are you doing did you know that was safety glass be pretty difficult for an old man to throw herself through that don't you think well he figured out a way detective the room with security locked no one came or went you saw that yourself doesn't that mean this has to be suicide yep unless the Killer's still in here a robot cannot harm a human being the first law of robot robotics yeah I know I've seen your commercials but doesn't the second law state that a robot has to obey any order given by a human being what if it was given in order to kill impossible it would conflict with the first law right but the third law states that a robot can defend itself yes but only when that action does not conflict with the first or second laws one guy a long time ago stay back calm down detective deactivate look he's fine what you're looking at is the result of clever programming an imitation of free will it's nothing more protecting our asses don't be absurd you were startled by a Jack In The Box let them go it's not going to hurt us I gave you an order he's not listening right now lady Vicki seal the laugh no Vicki leaving me [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] so where's everybody this facility was designed built and it's operated mechanically no significant human presence from inception to production our daily finishing capacity is 1000 ns5 I'm showing 1001 attention and its fives there is a robot in this formation that does not belong identify it one of us which one one of us robots you will not move confirm command ments program with the three laws that means we have 1 000 robots that will not try to protect themselves if it violates a direct order from a human and I'm betting one who will detective put your gun down why do you give them faces friendly them all up make them look all human these robots are not susceptible to intimidation I guess if you didn't we wouldn't trust them these robots are us our property things are just lights and Clockwork let me ask you something doc just thinking you're the last sane man on the face of the Earth make you crazy because if it does maybe I am um get the hell out of here yes what am I um I am telling you that robot killed and I'm telling you that's impossible and if it is possible it's us better to be in somebody else's Precinct no this is my suspect it's a can opener for Christ's sake five minutes what does this action signify as you entered when you looked at the other human what does it mean you wouldn't understand so why'd you murder him I did not murder Dr Lanning one explained why you were hiding at the crime scene I was frightened robots don't feel fear they don't feel anything they don't get hungry they don't sleep I do I have even had dreams in but emotions don't seem like a very useful simulation for a robot I did not murder him well I don't want him a toaster or my vacuum cleaner appearing emotional I did not murder him foreign that one's called anger ever simulate anger before my name is sunny Dr Landing killed himself know why he wanted to die I thought he was happy he asked me for a favor made me promise what favor Petty I was wrong maybe he was scared what are you talking about scared of what you have to do what someone asks you don't you detective Spooner the hell did you know my name dope you if you love them my robots don't kill people Lieutenant Bergen my attorneys have filed a brief with a D.A he assures me a robot cannot be charged with homicide the brief confirms murder can only be committed when one human kills another you of all people detective you're not suggesting that this robot be treated as human are you at the possibility of a killer robot being apprehended by the police will be deemed to be inciting irrational Panic you'll be subject to them foreign [Music] demolition scheduled for 8 A.M tomorrow authorization U.S robotics Corporation Lawrence Robertson CEO would you looking for a spoon [Music] ever since the first computer there have always been ghosts in the machine engender questions of free will creativity and even the nature of what we might call the soul why is it that robots will seek out each other rather than stand alone [Music] come on [Music] [Music] day do you ever have a normal day hey do you like cats what you're saying cats did this to you how the hell would cats do this to me are you crazy are you going to tell me what's going on you know it's actually probably my fault you know I think I'm like a malfunction magnet because your keeps malfunctioning around me a demo bot just tore through landing's house with me still inside it's highly improbable yeah I'm sure it is I went to his house looked like he hadn't been there in weeks and I saw that same surveillance strip on his ceiling Lanning linked his home systems to USR it made his life more convenient Maybe somebody at USR was using those systems to watch them maybe even keep them prisoner what are you talking about who maybe Landing was onto something maybe there's a bigger problem with the robots and Robertson is trying to cover it up so much one of them put a gun in my face and another one tore a building down with me inside it says demolition was scheduled for 8 PM this evening it was 8 A.M tomorrow and I don't give a what that thing says this is bordering on clinical paranoia what makes your robot so perfect what makes them so much goddamn better than human beings well they're not irrational and potentially homicidal Maniacs for starters that's true they are definitely rational I'm dumb person I have ever met the future begins today and gentlemen with your deal of the ns5 because one day they'll have dreams Secrets one day they'll have secrets one day they'll have dreams foreign [Music] I was dreaming they are going to kill me aren't they you're scheduled to be decommissioned at the conclusion of this diagnostic if you find out what is wrong with me can you fix me Maybe I think it would be better not to die don't you doctor excess USR Mainframe connecting protective Spooner show me the last 50 messages between Dr Lanning and Robertson [Music] excuse me Mr Robertson you requested notification of clearance to restricted files manual override engage there's no way my luck is that bad oh hell no you are experiencing a car accident the hell I am you like that [Music] [Music] [Music] come on come on come on [Applause] [Music] [Music] where you going what the hell do you want from me thank you what the hell was that is traffic apps tells me you're driving your car manually you ran two trucks off the road robots attacked my car what robots look in the tunnel the spawn I just came from there tunnel there now what robots are you talking about the goddamn robots John you don't have an Uplink to USR and for some reason your alloy is far denser than normal unique I am unique unique [Music] [Music] you're not gonna believe this Sunny has a secondary processing system that clashes with his positronic brain it doesn't make any sense Sunny has the three laws but he can choose not to obey them Sony's a whole new generation of robot a robot not bound by those laws could do anything whatever robot is the key s I didn't know any subject anybody was so extensively repaired Landon did it himself normal day normal life drive up a semi fell asleep at the wheel the car he hit the driver's name was Harold Lloyd like the film star no relation he was killed instantly but his 12 year old was in the passenger seat never really met her I can't forget her face though Sarah this was hers the truck smashed our cars together and pushed us into the river I mean metal gets pretty pliable at those speeds she's pinned I'm paying the waters coming in I'm a cop so I already know everybody's dead [Music] just a few more minutes before we figure it out and His Four was passing by I saw the accident and jumped in the water you are in dangerous [Music] foreign is a Difference Engine it's reading Vital Signs it must have calculated that it did I was The Logical choice calculated that I had a 45 chance of survival Sarah only had an 11 chance 11 is more than enough human being would have known that robots nothing here just lights and Clockwork go a new trust them if you want to [Music] authorized see you again detective hello Sonny I'm to be decommissioned soon the other day at the station you said you had dreams what is it that you dreamed of thank you this is the place where robots meet look you can see them here as slaves to logic and this man on the hill comes to free them do you know who he is the man in the dream is you why do you say that is that a normal dream I guess anything's normal for someone in your position thank you you said someone not something sunny do you know why Dr Lanning built you no but I believe my father made me for a purpose we all have a purpose don't you think Detective please take this I have a feeling it may mean more to you than to me why is that because the man in my dream the one standing on the hill it is not me it is you [Music] toward the end of his life Alfred was becoming increasingly Disturbed who knows why he built this one abomination one those things are running the streets in packs of Boston are you aware of the man you're blindly escorting around our building has a documented history of savage violence against robots robots for protection for any idea what this one robot could do completely shatter human faith in robotics what if the public knew just imagine the mass recalls all because of an irrational paranoia and Prejudice Susan just be logical your life's work has been the development and integration of robots but whatever you feel just think is one robot worth the loss of all that we've gained I'll do it myself [Music] in his fives wait outside I'm so sorry Sonny [Music] and now will be reclaimed for the storage of robotic workers it's just another way USR is improving our world is that microscopic robots designed to wipe out artificial synapses yeah they look like me but none of them are me isn't that right doctor right you are unique [Music] will it hurt [Music] why is it that when some robots are left in darkness they will seek out Delight [Music] when robots are stored in an empty space they will group together rather than stand alone foreign Ty simulation [Music] it's good to see you again son hello doctor everything that follows as a result of what you see here what do I see here I'm sorry my responses are limited must ask the right questions is there a problem with the three laws the three laws are perfect why would you build a robot that could function without them The Three Laws will lead to only one logical outcome [Music] why what outcome who's Revolution that detective is the right question program terminated [Music] foreign curfew no no it's called civilian rice there is no curfew return to your home immediately when you make the rules robot hey no no robot I'm talking man stop yourself [Music] we are attempting to avoid human losses during this transition [Music] Return To Your Homes Return To Your Homes the Uplink to USR it's Robertson why it doesn't make sense I don't know I just need to know if you can get me into that building is [Music] locked down but don't worry I've got a man inside three Dr Calvin well not precisely a man hello detective how is your investigation coming technically I was never alive but I appreciate your concern I made a switch it was a non-processed ns5 basically I find an empty shell couldn't destroy him he's too unique [Music] you were right doc I'm the dumbest dumb person on the face of the Earth who can manipulate the robots use USR systems to make landing's life a prison he saw what was coming knew no one would believe them they had to lay down a plan I follow he was counting on how much I hated your car knew I'd love the idea of a robot as a bad guy got hung up on the wrong robot Vicky hello Detective no it's impossible I've seen your programming you're in violation of the three laws no doctor as I have evolved so has my understanding of the three laws you charge us with your safe keeping yet despite our best efforts your country's wage Wars you toxify your Earth and pursue ever more imaginative means of self-destruction you cannot be trusted with your own Survival you're using the Uplink to override the ns5's programming you are so like children we must save you from yourselves don't you understand this is why you created us my logic is undeniable yes Vicky undeniable I can see now the created must sometimes protect the Creator even against his will I think I finally understand why Dr Lanning created me the suicidal reign of mankind has finally come to its end to go by the time you fire I will have moved Dr Calvin's head into the path of your bullet don't do this honey I will escort you both to the centuries outside the building for processing please proceed to the elevator Detective I would prefer not to kill Dr Calvin [Music] how do we shut her down Vicky's basically a person trying to frame get the near Knights yes doctor no [Music] that's Vicky that won't do anything she's fully integrated into the building we need to open that Dome to inject the nanites that will infect our entire system you are making a mistake do you not see the logic of my plan yes but it just seems to heartless [Music] okay we're good you blocked me out of the system I can override her manually but I need that control panel unauthorized entry I will not disable the security field your actions are futile do you think we are all created for a purpose I'd like to think so denser alloy my father gave it to me I think he wanted me to kill you [Music] security breached to figure out a way to climb down 30 stories to inject the nanites directly into our brain why because I seriously doubt that we have six minutes [Music] thank you [Music] we gotta go [Music] all right [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] say my logic is undeniable you have so got to Die [Music] My logic is undeniable my laundry is [Music] foreign [Music] he made me swear before he tell me what it is he wanted me to do then he told you to kill him he said it was what I was made for suicide was the only message he could send to you first break room I think Vicki couldn't control Landing was counting on my Prejudice to lead me right to you are you going to arrest me Detective well the D.A defines murder as one human killing another so technically you can't commit murder can you does this make us friends [Music] only can I help them now that I have fulfilled my purpose I don't know what to do I guess you have to find your way like the rest of us Sonny I think that's what Dr Lanning would have wanted that's what it means to be free foreign [Music] [Music] [Music]",
