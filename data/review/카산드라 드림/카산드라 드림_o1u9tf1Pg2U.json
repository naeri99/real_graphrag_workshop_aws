  "transcript": "'Dream' is a sports drama comedy about a professional footballer who gets a bit of bad publicity and following the advice from his agency he decides to coach a team of homeless men and lead them to victory in the Homeless World Cup while a documentary filmmaker comes on board to document the whole thing and spin it into a heartfelt story It recently came to Netflix so I was eager to check it out as I quite like a few of the actors involved and I think Lee Byeong-Hun is a pretty consistent director when it comes to making entertaining movies however he does something here that makes this movie so... uninteresting to watch because the core idea should sound like a solid foundation for a feel-good movie but it's presented in a way that feels so disingenuous as the footballer is only involved because he wants to clean up his image and the filmmaker is similarly doing this to benefit her career so for the majority of the movie I never really got the feeling like either of them actually cared or wanted to help these people in need unless it could be beneficial in some way and one of the biggest issues that comes from this self-centred characterization essentially boils down to this documentary filmmaker taking advantage of the situation to manufacture a touching story for example, when this footballer is putting together the team the filmmaker is telling him who to pick based on how their struggles will draw sympathy from an audience within the movie rather than director Lee Byeong-Hun earning an actual audience's sympathy through a more earnest approach and this becomes pretty common with how the movie is directed in general but I also feel like because of this we don't really get to spend much time with these homeless men on a personal level apart from being fed the occasional glimpse into their backstory it just feels quite forcefully done in a way that expects you to feel for them without really earning it while taking a concept like this and devaluing it under this guise of sincerity by spending most of the time with the wrong characters and I think it's quite ironic that a movie that aims to tell a heartfelt and uplifting story kind of disregards the actual heart of the movie in favour of two actors with the bigger star power now don't get me wrong I've generally enjoyed what I've seen of Park Seo-Joon and Lee Ji-Eun in other movies... and they were one of the main reasons for why I wanted to watch this one but I found their characters here to be very unlikable and I was incredibly disappointed that Lee Byeong-Hun had the opportunity to tell a compelling and meaningful story about a group of underprivileged people and chose to focus on two characters who have no genuine interest in the subject matter I also can't help but feel like it's such a bizarre creative choice to have the lead characters be two people who are trying to keep their jobs almost at the expense of a group of homeless men who literally have nothing and because of that disconnect and lack of character development it was hard for me to really get invested or be engaged with the story when the writing and direction makes for such an uninteresting watching experience it isn't until the final half hour of this two hour movie that I'm finally starting to get into it and I think a large part of that is because the footballer and filmmaker finally take a back seat and the heart of the movie can finally become the centre of attention as these homeless men begin to compete in the Homeless World Cup and I could finally start to feel some value to this story that comes from their joint determination as they aim to accomplish something that's meaningful to them on a personal level it's honestly just a shame that it comes so late in the movie because the supporting cast are easily the best and most enjoyable aspect and it's because of them that the movie finds its way to an entertaining and worthwhile finale apart from that, as you can probably tell I didn't really like the movie and I thought the entertainment value was pretty underwhelming in comparison to the director's previous films but it's on Netflix... and I guess if you're coming to this movie solely for Park Seo-Joon or Lee Ji-Eun then you'll probably enjoy watching them, alongside a slice of light entertainment",
