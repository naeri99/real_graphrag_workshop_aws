up a second Bank in Texas and I'm here overseeing you in Mainland bank which I can't even get in the front door of you won't have to if you let me run this one is foreign and put it in the contract three months ago you didn't know the first thing about banking I can't become my own man here that I think I need to resign and go back to LA it is now we got a bad kid with 90 days of banking

proud to put on the show first uniform well Joe was born with the silver spoon in his mouth for him it's like playing dress-up well I was and I was barely born with a spoon how many times have I worn this uniform to help this business you're a woman yeah I love you Bernard but how is that any different from a white man telling you you shouldn't mind some daily assault on your dignity because you have lacks as of close of business Friday the total number of loans delinquent Beyond 60 days was under 5 percent yes what was the exact percentage three percent we are discussing confidential information take me through this transaction there's no description for that maybe it's a broker's fee is okay let's turn to the loans themselves show me the methodology you used to justify that book value I have an expert to do that bring him in please but I can check his files to know the exact methodology we use to Value the loans in the package okay so standard present value equation this is an individual loans monthly payment schedule now adjust that with the risk factor for default standard five percent in Texas tear that out for me you can't go in the room that piece of paper it's got burnout's hand right now your bank this is your bank mat now pull it together and go out there and save it this loan's gonna have to be sold off immediately well that loan is for 21 000 your Capital account is two hundred thousand dollars okay the national Banking Act specifies that no Bank shall have a single loan on the books that exceeds 10 percent of equity capital okay but this one's only four thousand or twenty five year term same with this one Bank of the size is limited to 20-year terms how the hell did these loans get in the package I don't know I looked over every individual loan mat there was nothing over twenty thousand dollars nothing over 20 years how did our lawyer miss that Florence he switched the goddamn mortgages why why would he do that to kill Marlon then the worst part about it is I have to learn about it here and it's ridiculous outfit that you helped him do it no no that's got to be illegal right what does he get from that anyway it's leverage against us at Maine or maybe just to watch us fail Ure I'm not going to lose Marlin there's got to be something I can do I'm sorry man I know it was your baby but I need you to focus on Mainland now [Music] yeah it is Joe called me yesterday to say Matt Steiner managed to get all must sell loans offline who the hell would pay face value for those piece of loans Mainland Bank in Willis Texas it's just temporary it's fraud no if we classify them differently if you keep this up you're going to sink both Banks mad [Applause] Ness the treasury Department has revoked mainland's license to do banking Mr Steiner you're fired I'm going to need to escort you from the building now please leave the ledgers where they are the United States Treasury Department has closed this bank until further notice I'm so sorry get out of my face Bernard Garrett and Justin Morse yes FBI you're under arrest that's my feeling that we're in a political space here it is the goal seems to be to all over the so-called lacks oversight that our treasury provides so what does that have to do with me we need to change it things like these can own Banks and Loan money to others that foreign you have a choice now take the immunity deal you took advantage of lack's rules in order to enrich yourself or you can refuse the deal say whatever you want um our nation's founding documents declare that all men are created equal are these uh how these two men manipulated you used you to make money by duping everyday citizens into thinking you were the boss when really pulling the strikes the dress code I can't get a loan you can't own a home you can't start a business Mr Garrett you have been warned which means you can't build wealth Mr Karen you're excluded from the American Dreams remove the witness why is it so important to you to exclude an entire race of people from the American dream foreign foreign [Music]",

bring him in please but I can check his files to know the exact methodology we use to value the loans in the package okay so standard present value equation this is an individual loan's monthly payment schedule now adjust that with the risk factor for default standard five percent in Texas tear that out for me you can't go in the room that piece of paper it's got Burnett's hand right now your bank this is your bank Matt now pull it together and go out there and save it this loan's gonna have to be sold off immediately well that loan is for 21,000 your capital account is two hundred thousand dollars okay the National Banking Act specifies that no bank shall have a single loan on the books that exceeds 10 percent of equity capital okay but this one's only four thousand or twenty five year term same with this one bank of the size is limited to 20-year terms how the hell did these loans get in the package I don't know I looked over every individual loan Matt there was nothing over twenty thousand dollars nothing over 20 years how did our lawyer miss that Florence he switched the goddamn mortgages why why would he do that to kill Marlin then the worst part about it is I have to learn about it here and it's ridiculous outfit that you helped him do it no no that's got to be illegal right what does he get from that anyway it's leverage against us at Mainland or maybe just to watch us fail sure I'm not going to lose Marlin there's got to be something I can do I'm sorry man I know it was your baby but I need you to focus on Mainland now yeah it is Joe called me yesterday to say Matt Steiner managed to get all must sell loans offline who the hell would pay face value for those piece of loans Mainland Bank in Willis Texas it's just temporary it's fraud no if we classify them differently if you keep this up you're going to sink both banks Matt the treasury Department has revoked Mainland's license to do banking Mr. Steiner you're fired I'm going to need to escort you from the building now please leave the ledgers where they are the United States Treasury Department has closed this bank until further notice I'm so sorry get out of my face Bernard Garrett and Justin Morse yes FBI you're under arrest that's my feeling that we're in a political space here it is the goal seems to be to all over the so-called lacks oversight that our treasury provides so what does that have to do with me we need to change it things like these can own banks and loan money to others that foreign you have a choice now take the immunity deal you took advantage of lack's rules in order to enrich yourself or you can refuse the deal say whatever you want um our nation's founding documents declare that all men are created equal are these uh how these two men manipulated you used you to make money by duping everyday citizens into thinking you were the boss when really pulling the strings the dress code I can't get a loan you can't own a home you can't start a business Mr. Garrett you have been warned which means you can't build wealth Mr. Garrett you're excluded from the American dream remove the witness why is it so important to you to exclude an entire race of people from the American dream foreign foreign"
