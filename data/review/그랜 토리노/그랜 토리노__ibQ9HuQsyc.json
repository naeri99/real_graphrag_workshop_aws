  "transcript": "hello class my name is anthony villegas the film that i chose for my movie analysis presentation is gran torino starring clint eastwood in gran torino clint eastwood plays walt kowalski a retired korean war veteran who just lost his wife the film takes place in 1972 detroit michigan decades after the korean war has ended aging veteran walt is still haunted by the horrors he witnessed on the battlefield the two objects that matter the most to kowalski in his life are the classic gran torino that represents his happier days working in the ford assembly plant and his dog walt is a racist angry old man who dislikes his sons their families he dislikes asians blacks and latinos in his community throughout the film walt is constantly using racial slurs walt is angry that all his neighbors are agents and he's the last american living in his neighborhood his neighbors are hmong people they are political refugees who immigrated to the us in the 1960s his neighbor dao van lor is a timid asian with no direction in life his cousin who is in the hmong gang tries to force them to join his gang dao's gang initiation would be to steal walt's 1972 gran torino dao fails and later the mong gang tries to force doubt to commit another crime but this time he refuses to go with the hmong gang and the hmong gang is trying to force him until walt steps in it's not going to work for me my mama said he dishonored the family and now he has to we're going to do that he'll start tomorrow morning oh no not tomorrow not anytime i don't even want him on my property i thought we went over all that it's very important to my mom that you accept and it would be an insult if you refuse why is this being put back on me all of a sudden he's the one who tried to steal my car all of a sudden i'm the bad guy look it's like my family is very traditional and would be very much upset if you don't let repay if he doesn't want to do it then let's just go sure yeah shut up all right tomorrow come on tomorrow thank you in this scene that was mom and sister as well as all of walt's hmong neighbors are grateful for walt having intervened in stopping the hmong gang for from forcing dao to commit another crime the multicultural context within which the action takes place can be seen in the clear distinction between the two cultures while being an american from an an individual individualistic culture sees it as nothing just wants to be left alone the hmong people are grateful and feel adapt to walt so they fill his porch with food and other gifts the distinction as shown in the clip is that the conservative americans had a low context culture while the monks have high context culture for instance dow having attempted to steal walt's gran torino brought shame not only to dao but everyone in tao's family dao's mother and sister proposed that he should work for walt in order to make amends for his wrongs but walt declines unlike walt who is overly independent and individualistic it is important to hmong people to make amends after dishonoring the family the actions of one affect everyone after hearing how important it is for thousand mother for him to say yes walt eventually agrees to let thou work for him for a week in order to repay his debt and restore honor back to his family identity changes evidence in the film particularly through walt's character in the beginning of the film walt is a stubborn racist angry anti-social overly conservative american who hates his neighbors she begins to change after getting to know dao and his sister sue as the film progresses when he opts to intervene more dealing with the gang that is terrorizing tao and his family he is also seen to mingle with his neighbors who belong to the hmong community despite expressing traits of dislike and racism towards them during the time chao was working for walt walt has down to home improvement on all of his hmong neighbors and begins to accept their gifts and love their food although wall originally angered by the rapid changes that are happening to his neighborhood he realizes that his attitude is pushing them further away from his family and by large the general society due to this walt relaxes his conservative attitude and accepts the influence that society was having on him during the time thou worked for walt and after his death was paid restoring honor to dao's family walt develops a friendship with dao and his sister sue he is no longer the angry anti-social person he was at the beginning of the film he doesn't give up the racial slurs but there's no longer any animosity behind his remarks that are racist plenty of beer how's it say [Music] [Music] hey what's what are you fish heads looking at anyway i think we should go into the other room not even a child people believe that the soul resides on the head so uh don't do that well sounds dumb but fine yeah and a lot of home people consider looking someone in the eye to be very rude that's why they look away when you look at them yeah anything else yeah some hmong people tend to smile or grin when they're yelled at it's a cultural thing it expresses embarrassment or insecurity it's not that they're laughing at you or anything you people are nuts in gran torino non-verbal codes are evident in a number of instances and which to a large extent seem to be the source of cultural conflict for instance walt being american he's accustomed to looking at people straight into their eyes it's what most americans do in hmong culture it's people find it offensive to look at other people straight into the eyes they're accustomed to looking down furthermore he finds it amusing to pat children especially on their foreheads it's normal in american culture but offensive in hmong culture these two actions by walt can be seen as unacceptable to the monks who get offended every time walt does this what are we doing what do you want to do share your tools in the lice bag you can use one of these and you'll need one of these here i can't afford any of this i'll cover it you can pay me back on your first paycheck cool here you'll need something like that and this is what i'm looking for here too there you go not to but wouldn't i be needing some tools tools i've got but i'm not going to lend you my tool belt you can pick up tools as you go i really appreciate all this forget it no i really do thank you towards the end of the film woah is no longer a racist angry anti-social human being he's someone who helps and cares about dao and his family's well-being and also the rest of his hmong neighbors bald having become dao's friend and mentor changes styles life for the better he's no longer timid",
