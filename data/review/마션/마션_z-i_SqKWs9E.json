  "transcript": "[Music] over there Whitney well you'll be happy to hear that alert the media sorry what are you doing today Martinez and making sure the MAV is still up right we have a mission update storm warning storm warning I saw that in this morning's briefing yeah they they upgraded their estimate the storm's going to be a lot worse Martinez not good 1200 kilometers in diameter bearing 24.41 degrees that's tracking right towards us Commander prep emergency departure Commander we're scrubs that's an order Martinez how long before takeoff 12 minutes [Music] Commander we're at 10 degrees and the map is going to tip at 12.3 [Music] [Music] negative complete [ __ ] how long can he survive decompression less than a minute we're at 10.5 degrees tilting to 11. with all the ghosts of wind s get in prep for lunch [Music] Martinez what about the proximity radar [Music] Commander I know you don't want to hear this but Mark is dead stability warning you need to get back to the ship now 13 degrees thanks to the quick action of Commander Lewis astronauts Beck Johansson Martinez and Vogel were all able to reach the Mars Ascent vehicle and perform an emergency launch at 7 28 Central Time unfortunately during the evacuation astronaut Mark Watney was struck by debris and killed Commander Lewis and the rest of her team were able to intercept safely with the Hermes and are now heading home but Mark Watney is dead foreign [Music] [Music] hello this is Mark Watney astronaut I'm entering this log for the record uh in case I don't make it uh it is oh 6.53 on Soul 19 and I'm alive obviously but I'm guessing that's going to come as a surprise to my crewmates and to NASA best I can figure this length of our primary Communications antenna broke off and tore through my bio monitor and ripped the hole in me as well but the the antenna and the blood really managed to seal the breach in my suit which kept me alive I have no way to contact NASA and even if I could it's going to be four years until a manned mission can reach me and I'm going to have designed to last 31 days if the oxygenator breaks I'm going to suffocate if the water reclaimer breaks I'll die of thirst if they have breeches I'm just going to kind of implode and if by some miracle none of that happens eventually I'm going to run out of food [Music] and sour chicken right let's do the math our service Mission here was supposed to last 31 souls for redundancy they send 68 Souls worth of food that's for six people so for just me that's going to last 300 Souls which I figure I can stretch to 40 if I rations so I gotta figure out a way to grow three years worth of food here on a planet where nothing grows luckily I'm a botanist Mars will come to fear my botany powers [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] cubic meter of soil requires 40 liters of water to be farmable so I gotta make a lot more water good thing is I know the recipe now I have hundreds of liters of unused hydrazine at the MDB if I run the hydrazine over an iridium catalyst it'll separate into N2 and H2 and then if I just direct the hydrogen into a small area and burn it [Music] onward and upward in the mission of their agency I need you to authorize my satellite time not gonna happen got 12 satellites up there surely we could spare a few hours what about the satellite Time Fence the second we point the satellites that they have I broadcast pictures of Mark watney's dead body to the world you're afraid of a PR problem Congress won't reimburse us for a paper clip if I put a dead astronaut on the front page of the Washington Post it's a good cover sit down and have Anisha is security this is Mindy Park in saccon I need the emergency contact for Vincent Kapoor how sure 100 you've got to be [ __ ] me according to the logs Commander Lewis took it out Soul 17 plugged it into the hab to recharge it's been moved well why don't we just ask Lewis let's get on Capcom and ask her directly right now no no if Watney is really alive we don't want the Aries 3 crew to know how can you not tell them they have another 10 months on their trip home the space travel is dangerous they need to be alert and undistracted even imagine what he's going through up there I mean he's 50 million miles away from home he thinks he's totally alone he thinks we gave up on him I mean what does that do to him as psychologically [Music] next NASA mission is Aries four and it's supposed to land at the scarabarelli crater 3 200 kilometers away 32. okay so here's the rub I've got one working Rover designed to go a max distance of 35 kilometers before the battery has to be recharged at the half that's right [Music] I have doubled my battery life by Scavenging Rover one but if I use the heater I will burn through half my battery every day good news I may have a solution to my heating problem bad news it involves me digging up the radioisotope thermoelectric generator now if I remember my training correctly one of the lessons was titled don't dig up the big box of plutonium mark I get it rtgs are good for spacecraft but if they rupture around humans No More Humans you think about the fact that I'm warm because I have a decaying radioactive isotope riding right behind me but right now I got bigger problems on my hands 76 kilometers am I reading that right Bruce what's the earliest we can get a presupply there well with the positions of Earth and Mars it'll take nine months it'll take six months to build it in the first place three months foreign once there's a real rescue plan we'll tell them otherwise it's moot it's been 48 Souls since I planted the potatoes so now it's time to reap and re-sew they grew even better than I expected I know what I'm gonna do oh he's moving again there's nothing out there except what I need a map yeah okay so where's the Hat location uh 31.2 degrees north 28.5 degrees west where's Watney uh okay [Music] okay I know where he's going I need to get on an airplane [Music] one of the chances Malcolm getting working again it's hard to say we lost contact in 97. you think it was battery failure is this the replica this is her okay let's see it that's fine [Music] foreign [Music] okay uh camera [Music] you're taking panoramic image now are you receiving me yes no okay point the camera yes yes so here's the rub somehow we have to have complex astrophysical engineering conversations from 1996 I figured one of you guys Captain ASCII table lying around I was right I know where he's going with us [Music] [Music] [Music] now that we can have more complicated conversations the smart people at Nasa have sent me instructions on how to hack the Rover so that it can talk to Pathfinder how's the crew what did they say when they found out I was alive foreign told the crew you are alive yet we need them to concentrate on their mission what the f word f word in German form f word again is problem is Mark's right the longer we weigh the worse it's going to get we need to tell the crew you're bringing this up while Vincent is in Pasadena so he can't argue the other side hi hello hello Mark Watney is still alive we found out two months ago and uh decided not to tell you two months oh my God I am strongly against that decision we're telling you now because we finally have communication with him and a viable rescue plan we'll give you a write-up of of what happened a full write-up of everything but it but it's not your fault monk stresses that every time it comes out take some time to absorb this and um send all the questions you want we'll answer them so oh one big bonus to this communication with NASA again is the email I'm getting them again they say that once you grow crops somewhere you've officially colonized it so technically I colonized Mars operation I want to announce we're launching some supplies to them next year during the home and transfer window gross your team still on schedule it'll be tight but we'll make it nine month travel time that puts the probe to Mars on Saul 868. did we get the box [Music] 912 Souls worth of food we get there on 868 that's assuming nothing goes wrong [Music] [Music] [Music] complete loss of pressure boiled off most of the water any bacteria that survived died in the subzero temperatures when exposed to Mars's atmosphere how long does he have rations get him to what soul 409. potatoes 609. so if I saw 868 he'll be long dead we're gonna have to learn yeah we're working on it dear mark apparently NASA is letting us talk to you now and I drew the Short Straw we left you behind Mars but we just don't like you house bars dear Martinez Mars is fine every day I go outside and look at the vast Horizons every day I go outside and look at the vast Horizons just because I can just because I can tell the others I said hello I'm gonna do buddy is the probe going to be ready on time we're behind give me a number 15 days 15 days and I can get it done can we reduce it actually only takes three days to mount the probe 10 days of Texas inspections how often do those inspections reveal a problem well he's suggesting we don't do the inspections no it can't take that chance Dr Keller stretch watney's rations four more days you're not going to like it but that'll get us to 15 and we'll cancel the inspections it's on me foreign [Music] we are getting a very large procession are we good fight is hitting the red line lost readings on the boat flight s we've lost your flight I may need you to do something I die I need you to check in with my parents please tell them tell them I love what I do um and I'm really good at it tell him I said I can live with that until thank you for being my mom and dad we substituted protein um Central thank you yes and now we're gonna attempt to finish it in 28. 00 I'm sorry who are you my name is Rich Purnell I work in astrodynamics and you should hang up the phone I know how to save my wife tell them what you just told me I can get the Hermes back to Mars but I sold 561. and right now the Hermes is headed towards you starting its month-long deceleration intercept but instead you start accelerating immediately to preserve velocity and gain even more we don't intercept with Earth at all but we come close enough to get a gravity assist and a just course while we're doing that we resupply with the probe the tying Shin pick up whatever Provisions we need and now we're accelerating towards Mars now we're going too fast at this point to fall into orbit but we can do a flyby or it could fly by if we can't get lightning off the surface Rodney would intercept using the MAV oh I've done math checks out is he right yep Bruce what do you think well at Vincent says so but what about the Hermes crew we'd be asking them to add 533 extra days to their mission yeah they wouldn't hesitate enough for a second can the Hermes function for 533 days beyond the scheduled mission built to last the full Aries Mission so technically it's only halfway through its lifespan but if something goes wrong then we lose the crew so what we either have a high chance of killing one person or low chance of killing six people um still have a chance to bring five astronauts home safe and sound I'm not risking their lives you goddamn account [Music] I don't really know what we're looking at it's um does that make any sense course maneuver for the Hermes the mission concludes with Earth intercept 211 days later would it work we ran the numbers they check out it's a brilliant course so wild the Cloak and Dagger because it goes directly against NASA's decision yeah if we do the maneuver they'd have to send the supply ship where we die we have the opportunity to force their hand so we're gonna do it this is something NASA expressly rejected we're talking about Mutiny here which is not a word that I take lightly so we do this together or not at all and before you answer consider the consequences families again 533 days of unplanned space travel where anything could go wrong if it's Mission critical we die I guarantee they will never send you back up here again if we do this it will be over 900 days of space [Music] that's more than enough space for one life so yes how about yes let's go get him yeah Roger read it out Mrs reads Houston please be advised Rich Parnell is a steely-eyed missile man flight guidance Hermes is off course Capcom advised Hermes their drifting guidance get a correction ready negative flight it's not drift leave it just of course you may have killed the Mitch we're fighting the same War every time something goes wrong the world forgets why we fly I'm trying to keep his airborne it's bigger than one person now I saw so okay I've got 200 souls to figure out how to take everything here that's keeping me alive the oxygenator the water reclaimer the atmospheric regulator on planet Earth really all of the brain power on the entire planet helping me with this endeavor and so far they've come up with hey why don't you drill holes in the roof of your Rover and hit it as hard as you can with a rock ET [Music] oh Mark Watney space pirate [Music] Everywhere I Go I'm the first it's a strange feeling step outside the Rover first guy to be there climb that Hill first guy to do that [Music] now me the first person to be alone on an entire planet the MAV that was only designed to get to low mass orbit so in order for Mark to escape Mars's gravity entirely and to intercept the Hermes it has to be gone fast exactly which means we need to make the map lighter a lot we need to remove the nose hair lock the windows and whole panel 19. 400 kilograms you want to send a man into space without the fun of it no no [Music] the launch takes 12 minutes and it'll be 52 minutes before intercept once Mark's engine shuts off we'll know our intercept point and velocity you go out after him yep let's go get our boy [Music] fuel pressure green engine alignment perfect Mission Control this is Hermes actual we will proceed on schedule about two minutes what day how are you doing down there I'm good I'm anxious to get up to thanks for coming back for me well we're on it I can swatney hang on velocity 741 meters per second altitude 1350 meters that's too low it's fighting me gosh Theory I think there's some sort of problem with the transmission I have interval pings intercept velocity will be 11 meters per second I can make that work hang on it it brings the range to zero but the intercept velocity will be 42 meters per second and that's way too fast [Music] [Applause] well how bad is it well we've corrected The Intercept range but we've got a problem with intercept velocity how big a problem what happens if we blow the vowel well you want to open the vehicular airlock it'll give us a good kick yeah but also blow the nose off the ship and all the air would leave and we need air to not die we would seal the bridge and the reactor room everywhere else we'll go vacuum thank you liquid oxygen and some stain remover that contains ammonia the singer five times stronger than the sake of dynamite how do we activate it to connect this to one of your lighting panels [Music] bomb say guys I'm running the numbers and even with optimal valve blow we're going to be off on our angle what's the intercept distance 260 meters of approximate too far Commander distance is too far I'm going out I can do this it's not a debate I'm not risking another crew member Vick's returned Johansson initiate the bomb five four three grace for deceleration two one activating panel 41. please Bridge still holding lots of damage worry about that later what's the relative velocity 12 meters per second puppy hook me up done I visual on the map what's the intercept range I'm checking 312 meters did you say 312 great I'll wave it you guys as I go by you can't get to your mark you're too far I'm not gonna make it I know Beck unhook me I'm going after him Commander I got this Mark report on my way Commander box so handsome what's my relative velocity to Mark 5.2 meters per second 3.1 meters per second 54 meters six meters hold on Mark all right I got it I got it way to go Iron Man [Music] Houston this is Hermes actual we got him walking insecure hey handsome hey guys guys Houston Texas crew safely aboard [Music] [Applause] there's a little snow going on over there I haven't had a shower in a year [Music] [Music] this is space it does not cooperate [Music] [Music] is foreign foreign [Music] [Music]",
