  "transcript": "[Music] tenant was written and directed by christopher nolan and it's here to hopefully save theaters around the world as they begin to reopen i saw this at a press screening only five people were permitted in the theater the theater was closed at the time everyone wore masks there was hand sanitizer all over the place it was my first time going to a traditional theater since march when i saw bloodshot i've been to a drive-in this summer but this is the longest span of time that i haven't been in a real theater since i was an infant it was very surreal to go see a movie like this on a big screen armed with only one word tenant and fighting for the survival of the entire world a protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time i just read the official plot synopsis on imdb because it's the easiest way to summarize the plot of the film without spoilers if i were to actually go into the plot of this movie right now it would take the length of a normal review just to discuss that this is a very complex movie despite its attempts to explain itself to us at multiple times the film is a little inaccessible at first for the first hour or so of the movie you're sort of running to catch up to figure out what this world is who our hero is and what exactly his place in this world is it's about halfway through the movie that things become clearer nolan's a big fan of mystery he wants to have the audience ask a lot of questions he likes keeping things from you as you watch the movie for a long time and he respects you in that way hoping that you go on that journey with him and he continues that with tenant tenant is a film that a lot of people will love but perhaps a similar amount of people will not love it's a very inaccessible movie at times especially compared to nolan's other films even films like inception where people came out saying i don't understand that movie i was confused by it i remember being like why it's very simple it's very easy to follow tenant is considerably more complex than inception and it really is going to take multiple viewings to truly appreciate the movie because there's so much that's hidden throughout the course of the movie and so much that that flies by very quickly very important insert shots for instance that happened very quickly early on in the scene that later in the movie really mean something for the characters i respect a filmmaker who takes the amount of studio money that he does to make these audacious movies that make people scratch their heads tenant is not nolan's best film by a long shot but i really liked it i really enjoyed watching this film the spectacle is awe-inspiring visually it's miraculous the things he's able to accomplish in camera with very little visual effects is really impressive people are moving forwards in a scene while others in the scene are moving backwards sometimes people who are moving forwards and moving backwards at the same time fight or are engaged in a highway chase with one another to watch that occur on the screen is fabulous it's incredible to see this movie is visually stunning in every way the highlights being that fight scene that i mentioned although it is not as remarkable as the hallway fight scene in inception as well as a building that seems to reassemble itself while also blowing up as the camera tilts upwards really incredible stuff with tenant nolan continues his interest perhaps even obsession with time and the manipulation of it in the past his films have often featured non-linear storylines here he takes this a step further by featuring objects and even people who are all moving in different directions and spaces of time within one frame the film calls it inversion i won't go any further into it than that we'll keep it non-spoiler you guys saw all of these images in the trailers anyway the acting is also strong john david washington is really good in the film as is robert pattinson elizabeth debicki is also very good in the film all of the acting all around is very good kenneth branagh plays a villainous character and he's really big in the movie like he's really chewing the scenery but he worked for me uh if you want to go there go there and he goes there and i think he's really good in the film nolan's usual composer collaborator han zimmer couldn't do this film because of his work on dune and so ludwig garrinson from ryan coogler's films like black panther and creed replaced him and he's really [ __ ] good i've loved all of this man's scores he he won the oscar for black panther i think he's one of our new best talents when it comes to music honestly you could probably watch this and think han zimmer did it without knowing a lot of the music does sound as if it has a reversed quality to it which matches obviously you know some of the spectacle on the screen speaking of sound though nolan continues this thing he's been doing ever since dark knight rises where dialogue seems to be the bottom of the mix and sound effects and score are above it so there are many scenes where i honestly didn't know what people were saying and i saw this at a cinemark xd so this is a massive theater with really state-of-the-art sound and i'm not sure why he does that it's like ever since tom hardy was bane he was like i i like when people don't quite understand what everyone's saying all the time interstellar had very loud music and you can watch the film multiple times and get more out of it but nolan likes to do a thing in all of his movies where his characters take leisurely strolls through very picturesque environments and they usually give expository dialogue during these scenes it happens a lot in inception happens quite often in tenet and often times that score which as i said is wonderful is often blaring during these sequences which makes dialogue a little difficult to hear also characters are speaking very fast and very quick tenet is technically marvelous and conceptually fascinating but it is however emotionally distant we know so little about each character particularly our lead that nolan seems to be deliberately keeping them at arm's length so while i was always amazed by what he was accomplishing within a frame i didn't really care that much about the people that were filling that frame elizabeth debicki's character is easily the most emotionally resonant of the entire film there's a subplots that i won't spoil for you but basically she's the heart and soul of the movie and she's really all that john david washington's character which is just called the protagonist he doesn't even have a name she's really all that that he's feeling for in the movie and and his real motivation for being in the movie seems wrapped up into helping her and so as a lead the protagonist isn't a particularly interesting character he feels like an object that's used to communicate nolan's story to us and less like a person this is something that happens a lot in his films in a movie like inception a lot of those characters are intriguing but you know you don't really know that much about them the film just works a little bit better though because there is a central reason for cobb being there and you understand why he's there you understand why everyone is working towards a goal in this movie nolan deliberately keeps a lot of that from you until the end and even then once you experience a reveal of sorts it absolutely re-contextualizes the rest of the movie it just doesn't really do it in a way that enhances the people it enhances the plot this is a very plot heavy film it's a a plot over a character movie without a doubt and most of nolan's films are this one though is held up so much by an incredible amount of visual spectacle that is constantly exciting and different and new it's another intriguing and fascinating film from one of our most daring filmmakers working within the mainstream system and it will likely be enhanced by repeat viewings however i'm not going to a theater a second time right now to see a movie i've already seen i'm going to wait to see it again on blu-ray which i'm looking forward to doing i'm going to give tenet a b-plus speaking of new movies uh the new mutants is apparently actually coming out this weekend they finally did it guys they they released that [ __ ] movie so i'll be seeing that hopefully i'm going to like a public oh showing tomorrow i don't know i don't know before before all this [ __ ] this year i was a germaphobe now that has only been enhanced exponentially so um i'll do my best to get a new mutants review out for you guys this weekend for sure i'm seeing bill and ted 3 because that's going to be on vod streaming so i'm looking forward to that guys thank you so much as always for watching and if you like this you can click right here and get stuck manized
